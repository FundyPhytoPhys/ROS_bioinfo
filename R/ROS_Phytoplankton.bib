  abstract = {Phytoplankton are microscopic photosynthesizing organisms that live in the sunlit layer of the ocean. They are of global importance, accounting for half of the primary productivity on Earth. Members of this group can undergo a programmed cell death process that has the hallmarks of apoptosis. The existence of apoptosis-like processes in phytoplankton raises the enigma of why single-celled organisms commit "suicide". Through our own work, and through interpretation of existing literature, we provide evidence suggesting that coccolithophores and diatoms, two key groups of phytoplankton, exhibit a multicellular-like state. These communities regularly aggregate, communicate and execute coordinated behaviors, which are traits that adhere to the core definition of multicellularity. If phytoplankton populations indeed exist in a multicellular-like organization, the benefits of apoptotic processes in phytoplankton could be studied in analogy to multicellular organisms. Given the central role of phytoplankton in many global scale processes, it is fascinating to think how these cells regularly exist in units of physically attached cells that potentially act semi-coherently across kilometer scale. In the bacterial world, our recognition of biofilms as multicellular arrangements furthered the study of bacterial communication and ecology. Similarly, we propose areas of research that would benefit from acknowledging the multicellular traits of phytoplankton. As our oceans become warmer, more stratified and more acidic, key communities of primary-producers are forced to rapidly adjust. Therefore, studying phytoplankton in a multicellular context would be significant in gaining a comprehensive view of phytoplankton physiology and ecology under changing conditions.},

  abstract = {Higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cancer cells than normal cells have long been recognized, which makes cancer cells more susceptible to excess ROS. Thus oxidation (also called pro-oxidant) therapy has been explored as new cancer therapy regimens. To produce additional ROS, e.g. H2O2 in situ within tumor, we encapsulated glucose oxidase in chitosan-coated alginate\textendash calcium microspheres (GOX-MS) for locoregional treatment and demonstrated its efficacy against cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Owing to the complex biological functions of ROS, the production rate and amount of H2O2 are critical to achieve therapeutic benefits without causing normal tissue toxicity. This work was therefore intended to investigate the effect of formulation factors, e.g., particle size and enzyme loading level, on the H2O2 generation kinetics and bioactivity of GOX-MS. In vitro studies revealed that, at the same GOX loading levels, smaller GOX-MS (20{$\mu$}m in diameter) generated more H2O2 and killed more cancer cells than the larger (140{$\mu$}M) GOX-MS. A mathematical model including simultaneous diffusion and enzymatic reaction was developed to describe the release kinetics of generated H2O2 from a GOX-loaded spherical polymeric matrix. Profiles of species concentration, pH, polymer volume fraction and solute diffusivity inside the microspheres were numerically calculated. The model predicted H2O2 release profile was verified by the experimental data. Numerical analysis predicted quantitatively how H2O2 generation increased with increasing GOX loading inside the GOX-MS, glucose concentration in the external solution, or with decreasing particle size. The findings and methodology presented herein are useful for optimizing the design of GOX-MS and applicable to understanding and development of other enzyme-encapsulated polymer microspheres.},

These enzymes carry out catalysis at near diffusion controlled rate constants via a general mechanism that involves the sequential reduction and oxidation of the metal center, with the concomitant oxidation and reduction of superoxide radicals. That the catalytically active metal can be copper, iron, manganese or, recently, nickel is one of the fascinating features of this class of enzymes. In this review, we describe these enzymes in terms of the details of their catalytic properties, with an emphasis on the mechanistic differences between the enzymes. The focus here will be concentrated mainly on two of these enzymes, copper, zinc superoxide dismutase and manganese superoxide dismutase, and some relatively subtle variations in the mechanisms by which they function.},

Measurements of photochemically generated NO, O2- and ONOO- were conducted on seawater samples obtained from the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. Nitrite, dissolved organic carbon, chromophoric dissolved organic matter and pH were also measured in the same samples using standard analytical methods. The average photoformation rates of NO, O2- and ONOO- were: 1.78 \texttimes{} 10-12 M s-1, 7.19 \texttimes{} 10-10 M s-1 and 9.0 \texttimes{} 10-10 M s-1, respectively, and the average steady-state concentrations were: 67.28 \texttimes{} 10-12 M, 2.69 \texttimes{} 10-12 M and 2.26 \texttimes{} 10-11 M, respectively. Further evaluation of the experimental data indicated that the existence of ONOO- in seawater strongly depends on, and is limited by, photoformed NO. Seawater alkalinity favored the consumption of photoformed NO{$\cdot$} via the peroxynitrite sink. The magnitude of average sinks (\%) calculated from kinetic estimates and experimental data were: 0.17\% and 0.11\%, respectively. These results show that the consumption of photochemically generated NO{$\cdot$} via the peroxynitrite sink is not significant in surface seawater. Therefore, we propose that sea\textendash to\textendash air efflux across the marine boundary layer is the major sink of photochemical NO{$\cdot$} and can be regarded as a non-anthropogenic contributor to daytime atmospheric NOx concentrations.},

I argue that sexism, racism, homophobia, and classism in formal and hidden curriculum could be as mortal and brutal as it happened in cases of Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and others. Dress codes convey sexism with a male center gaze and racism with White middle-class norms that serve as a hidden curriculum with inherent biases. That is, not acting White, not being lady-like, wearing butch-tomboy or ragged clothing, is disruptive to academic success. Discussing a dress code in a high school in a working-class Black community, I argue that like police officers, educators tend to make dangerous judgments about bodies. Finally, to stop the harmful reproduction of such judgments, I suggest what Judith Butler calls ``subversive repetition'' and ``subversive citation'' (Butler 1990, p. 147) which allows resisting the everyday experiences that produce oneself to address the question that how can we, as teachers, school administrations, and teacher educators, resist those practices that produce our bodies as vulnerable and potential victims and others' bodies as dangerous and potential violators. To problematize, to conceptualize, and to enhance the above-mentioned argument, I will draw on several feminist frameworks such as performativity (Butler 1990), intersectionality (Crenshaw 1989), and objectification (Fredrickson and Roberts 1997).}

The natural communities of pico-phytoplankton populations tested experienced high cell mortality when exposed to high solar radiation, despite inhabiting tropical waters. Synechococcus and eukaryotes were more resistant to solar radiation than Prochlorococcus. The decay rates of all pico-phytoplankton groups examined tended to be much higher when exposed to total solar radiation than when UVB-R was filtered out. We also show that even short exposures of 30 min to high solar radiation were able to induce cell mortality in Prochlorococcus. The variability in the decay rates of living Prochlorococcus cells were strongly related to the condition of the original population. However, Synechococcus decay rates were higher in populations from the tropical area, with eukaryotes sensitivity increasing with increasing the trophic degree. The data reported in this study and in the literature revealed contrasting capacities of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and eukaryotes to survive under high solar radiation. Although the mechanisms involved are as yet unclear, their elucidation may help explain niche partitioning among these organisms in the ocean.},

  abstract = {Coprinus cinereus peroxidase (CIP) and other peroxidases are susceptible to mechanism-based inactivation during the oxidation of phenolic substrates. The turnover capacity (defined as the molar or mass concentration of substrate oxidized per unit concentration of enzyme inactivated) of CIP was quantified for phenol and 11 monosubstituted phenols under conditions in which enzyme inactivation by mechanisms involving hydrogen peroxide alone were minimized. Turnover capacities varied by nearly 2 orders of magnitude (absolute values on the order of 105-106 on a molar basis), depending on the substituent. On a mass basis, the enzyme consumption corresponding to the lowest turnover capacities is considerable and may influence the economic feasibility of proposed industrial applications of peroxidases. Within a range of substituent electronegativity values, molar turnover capacities correlated well (r2 = 0.89) with substituent effects quantified by radical {$\sigma$} values and semiquantitatively with homolytic O-H bond dissociation energies of the phenolic substrates, suggesting that phenoxyl radical intermediates are probably involved in the suicide inactivation of CIP. The correlation range in each case did not include phenols with highly electron-withdrawing (nitro and cyano) substituents because they are not oxidized by CIP, nor phenols with highly electron-donating (hydroxy and amino) substituents because they led to virtually complete inactivation of the enzyme with minimal substrate removal. In the latter case we conclude that inactivation of CIP during the oxidation of hydroxy- and amino-substituted phenols occurs by a different mechanism than that of the other phenolic substrates.},

With the aid of this system, the direct effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on human sperm function has been investigated. A protocol involving the addition of xanthine oxidase to the reaction mixture at 0 and 15 min resulted in a loss of motility involving every component of sperm movement examined. Lower doses of xanthine oxidase, which did not influence sperm motility, were also found to suppress the competence of human spermatozoa to exhibit oocyte fusion in response to the ionophore, A23187. The reactive oxygen species responsible for the disruption of human sperm function was not influenced by the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or scavengers of hypochlorous acid or hydroxyl radicals. However, the cytotoxic species was shown to be extremely stable and could be completely eliminated by catalase, which selectively eliminates H2O2. Confirmation that it is H2O2, and not O2-., which is cytotoxic to human spermatozoa was obtained in studies in which the direct addition of this oxidant was shown to influence both the movement of human spermatozoa and their competence for oocyte fusion. These results carry implications for the diagnosis of defective sperm function and the design of optimized culture media for the treatment of male factor infertility.},

The phytoplankton of a shallow, eutrophic brackish lagoon was investigated. Phytoplankton was dominated by Aphanothece-like morphospecies year-round for more than 20 years, along a trophy and salinity gradient. A biphasic approach using a culture-independent and a culture-dependent analysis was applied to identify the dominant species genetically. The 16S rRNA gene phylogeny of clone sequences and isolates indicated the dominance of Cyanobium species (order Synechococcales sensu Kom\'arek/clade C1 sensu Shih). This difference between morphologically and genetically based species identifications has consequences for applying the Reynolds functional-groups system, and for validity long-term monitoring data. The literature shows the same pattern as our results: morphologically, Aphanothece-like species are abundant in eutrophic shallow lagoons, and genetically, Cyanobium is found in similar habitats. This discrepancy is found worldwide in the literature on fresh- and brackish-water habitats. Thus, most Aphanothece-like morphospecies may be, genetically, members of Cyanobium.},

  abstract = {Aquaporins (AQP) conduct small, uncharged molecules, such as water (orthodox AQPs), ammonia (aquaammoniaporins) or glycerol (aquaglyceroporins). The physiological functions of AQPs are involved in osmotic volume regulation or the transport of biochemical precursors and metabolic waste products. The recent identification of hydrogen peroxide (H{$_2$}O{$_2$}) as a permeant of certain AQPs suggests additional roles in mitigating oxidative stress or enabling paracrine H{$_2$}O{$_2$} signalling. Yet, an analysis of the structural requirements of the H{$_2$}O{$_2$} permeability of AQPs is missing. We subjected a representative set of wild-type and mutant AQPs to a newly established quantitative phenotypic assay. We confirmed high H{$_2$}O{$_2$} permeability of the human aquaammoniaporin AQP8 and found intermediate H{$_2$}O{$_2$} permeability of the prototypical orthodox water channel AQP1 from the rat. Differences from an earlier report showing an absence of H{$_2$}O{$_2$} permeability of human AQP1 can be explained by expression levels. By generating point mutations in the selectivity filter of rat orthodox aquaporin AQP1, we established a correlation of H{$_2$}O{$_2$} permeability primarily with water permeability and secondarily with the pore diameter. Even the narrowest pore of the test set (i.e. rat orthodox aquaporin AQP1 H180F with a pore diameter smaller than that of natural orthodox AQPs) conducted water and H{$_2$}O{$_2$}. We further found that H{$_2$}O{$_2$} permeability of the aquaglyceroporin from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was lower despite its wider pore diameter. The data suggest that all water-permeable AQPs are H{$_2$}O{$_2$} channels, yet H{$_2$}O{$_2$} permeability varies with the isoform. Thus, generally, AQPs must be considered as putative players in situations of oxidative stress (e.g. in Plasmodium-infected red blood cells, immune cells, the cardiovascular system or cells expressing AQP8 in their mitochondria).},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

The prey\textendash predator interactions between them affect bloom dynamics, shape marine ecosystems and impact the energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Recently it has been demonstrated that the presence of grazers may affect the diatom prey beyond the direct effect of grazing. Here, we investigated the response of the chain-forming centric diatom Skeletonema marinoi to grazer cues, including changes in morphology, gene expression and metabolic profile. S. marinoi cells were incubated with Calanus finmarchicus or with Centropages typicus and in both cases responded by reducing the chain length, whereas changes in gene expression indicated an activation of stress response, changes in the lipid and nitrogen metabolism, in cell cycle regulation and in frustule formation. Transcripts linked to G protein-coupled receptors and to nitric oxide synthesis were differentially expressed suggesting involvement of these signalling transduction pathways in the response. Downregulation of a lipoxygenase in the transcriptomic data and of its products in the metabolomic data also indicate an involvement of oxylipins. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the gene function in diatoms, providing information on the nature of genes implicated in the interaction with grazers, a crucial process in marine ecosystems.},

Yet, most protists in the photic zone engage in some degree of phagotrophy, and it has been suggested that trophic strategy is really a continuum between pure phototrophs (phytoplankton) and pure phagotrophs (unicellular zooplankton). Such a continuum of trophic strategies is well represented by trait-based modelling techniques. A key model ingredient is the size of individual cells, as size constrains affinities for nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and active encounter with other cells. We outline a general trait-based model of a unicellular planktonic organism where size is a central trait and where nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and phagotrophy are determined by investments into these functions and by the physical constraints imposed by organism size. This framework provides simple predictions of how trophic strategy correlates with size.},

We show that plasma membrane NADPH oxidase activity is a significant component of light-dependent generation of electricity by the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. NADPH oxidases export electrons across the plasma membrane to form superoxide anion from oxygen. The C.~reinhardtii mutant lacking the NADPH oxidase encoded by RBO1 is impaired in both extracellular superoxide anion production and current generation in a BPV device. Complementation with the wild-type gene restores both capacities, demonstrating the role of the enzyme in electron export. Monitoring light-dependent extracellular superoxide production with a colorimetric assay is shown to be an effective way of screening for electrogenic potential of candidate algal strains. The results show that algal NADPH oxidases are important for superoxide anion production and open avenues for optimizing the biological component of these devices.},

Brain GSH depletion is considered a preclinical sign in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and it promotes the subsequent processes toward neurotoxicity. A neuroprotective mechanism accomplished by increasing GSH synthesis could be a promising approach in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In neurons, cysteine is the rate-limiting substrate for GSH synthesis. Excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) is a neuronal cysteine/glutamate transporter in the brain. EAAC1 translocation to the plasma membrane promotes cysteine uptake, leading to GSH synthesis, while being negatively regulated by glutamate transport associated protein 3-18 (GTRAP3-18). Our recent studies have suggested GTRAP3-18 as an inhibitory factor for neuronal GSH synthesis. Inhibiting GTRAP3-18 function is an endogenous mechanism to increase neuron-specific GSH synthesis in the brain. This review gives an overview of EAAC1-mediated GSH synthesis, and its regulatory mechanisms by GTRAP3-18 in the brain, and a potential approach against neurodegeneration.},

In contrast, values of photochemical quenching declined in leaves from untransformed controls at intercellular CO2 (Ci) values below 200 {$\mu$}L L-1 but remained constant with decreasing Ci in leaves of FeSOD transformants. When the O2 concentration was decreased from 21 to 1\%, the effect of FeSOD overexpression on photochemical quenching at limiting Ci was abolished. At high light (1000 {$\mu$}mol m-2s-1) a progressive decrease in the ratio of variable (F v) to maximal (F m) fluorescence was observed with decreasing temperature. At 6oC the high-light-induced decrease in theF v/F m ratio was partially prevented by low O2 but values were comparable in all lines. Methyl viologen caused decreasedF v/F m ratios, but this was less marked in the FeSOD transformants than in the untransformed controls. These observations suggest that the rate of superoxide dismutation limits flux through the Mehler-peroxidase cycle in certain conditions.},

This confirmed the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen in illuminated chloroplasts. In the presence of cytochrome c, hydrogen peroxide formation by chloroplasts was inhibited completely. Rates for the photoreduction of cytochrome c and the formation of hydrogen peroxide were equivalent, indicating that the univalent reduction of oxygen is a part of the Mehler reaction and the divalent reduction of oxygen is absent in chloroplasts. Spinach ferredoxin, cytochrome c-reducing substance, and phenazine methosulfate did not stimulate or decrease the superoxide dismutase-inhibited rates of the photoreduction of cytochrome c and photo-oxidation of epinephrine. Chloroplasts treated with histone, which blocked Photosystem I, could not photooxidize epinephrine.

  abstract = {The water-water cycle in chloroplasts is the photoreduction of dioxygen to water in photosystem I (PS I) by the electrons generated in photosystem II (PS II) from water. In the water-water cycle, the rate of photoreduction of dioxygen in PS I is several orders of magnitude lower than those of the disproportionation of superoxide catalysed by superoxide dismutase, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water catalysed by ascorbate peroxidase, and the reduction of the resulting oxidized forms of ascorbate by reduced ferredoxin or catalysed by either dehydroascorbate reductase or monodehydroascorbate reductase. The water-water cycle therefore effectively shortens the lifetimes of photoproduced superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals, their interactions with the target molecules in chloroplasts, and resulting photoinhibition. When leaves are exposed to photon intensities of sunlight in excess of that required to support the fixation of CO2, the intersystem electron carriers are over-reduced, resulting in photoinhibition. Under such conditions, the water-water cycle not only scavenges active oxygens, but also safely dissipates excess photon energy and electrons, in addition to downregulation of PS II and photorespiration. The dual functions of the water-water cycle for protection from photoinhibition under photon excess stress are discussed, along with its functional evolution.},

The rapid development of our understanding of NO biology in embryophytes came with the partial characterization of the pathways underlying its production and with the decrypting of signalling networks mediating its effects. Notably, the identification of proteins regulated by NO through nitrosation greatly enhanced our perception of NO functions. In comparison, the role of NO in algae has been less investigated. Yet, studies in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have produced key insights into NO production through the identification of NO-forming nitrite reductase and of S-nitrosated proteins. More intriguingly, in contrast to embryophytes, a few algal species possess a conserved nitric oxide synthase, the main enzyme catalysing NO synthesis in metazoans. This latter finding paves the way for a deeper characterization of novel members of the NO synthase family. Nevertheless, the typical NO\textendash cyclic GMP signalling module transducing NO effects in metazoans is not conserved in algae, nor in embryophytes, highlighting a divergent acquisition of NO signalling between the green and the animal lineages.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide concentrations, production rates and decomposition rates were measured during each of two 3-week cruises in August 1999 and March 2000 at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station. Patterns of variation in the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in surface seawater at BATS were drastically different in August of 1999 compared with March of 2000. In August, hydrogen peroxide concentrations were primarily controlled by input from rain, whereas in March, they were controlled by photochemical processes and showed diurnal variations. The highest concentrations in surface water in August followed rain events, whereas in March, they occurred at approximately 1400 after rapid photochemical production. This production in March was followed by an equally rapid loss of H2O2, probably driven by a secondary photochemical process, then by much slower decline at night. The combination of photochemical production and consumption processes resulted in a steady-state system over a 24-h period in March but not August. The dark decomposition of surface water hydrogen peroxide incubated in storage experiments was the same during both August and March and followed first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.009 h-1. This was in remarkably good agreement with the decay of the atmospheric hydrogen peroxide signal in surface seawater observed in August. The comparable rate constant for deep water from 200 m was about one-third of that for BATS surface seawater in March. Because filtered seawater had lower production rates than unfiltered seawater from the same depth, biological production may contribute to surface seawater hydrogen peroxide at BATS during the March spring plankton bloom, but it is not the dominant source.},

Due to global climate change, temperature stress is becoming the major area of concern for the researchers worldwide. The reactions of plants to these stresses are complex and have devastating effects on plant metabolism, disrupting cellular homeostasis and uncoupling major physiological and biochemical processes. Temperature stresses disrupt photosynthesis and increase photorespiration altering the normal homeostasis of plant cells. The constancy of temperature, among different metabolic equilibria present in plant cells, depends to a certain extent on a homeostatically regulated ratio of redox components, which are present virtually in all plant cells. Several pathways, which are present in plant cells, enable correct equilibrium of the plant cellular redox state and balance fluctuations in plant cells caused by changes in environment due to stressful conditions. In temperature stresses, high temperature stress is considered to be one of the major abiotic stresses for restricting crop production. The responses of plants to heat stress vary with extent of temperature increase, its duration and the type of plant. On other hand, low temperature as major environmental factor often affects plant growth and crop productivity and leads to substantial crop loses. The present review discusses how oxidative damage as a result of temperature stress is detrimental for various crops. Various strategies adapted by the plants to main redox homeostasis are described along with use of exogenous application of some stress protectants.},

In the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus\textemdash the most abundant phototroph in the oligotrophic oceans\textemdash the carbon-concentrating mechanism is reduced to the bare essentials. Given the ability of Prochlorococcus populations to grow under a wide range of oxygen concentrations in the ocean, we wondered how carbon and oxygen physiology intersect in this minimal phototroph. Thus, we examined how CO2:O2 gas balance influenced growth and chlorophyll fluorescence in Prochlorococcus strain MED4. Under O2 limitation, per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence fell at all CO2 levels, but still permitted substantial growth at moderate and high CO2. Under CO2 limitation, we observed little growth at any O2 level, although per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence fell less sharply when O2 was available. We explored this pattern further by monitoring genome-wide transcription in cells shocked with acute limitation of CO2, O2 or both. O2 limitation produced much smaller transcriptional changes than the broad suppression seen under CO2 limitation and CO2/O2 co-limitation. Strikingly, both CO2 limitation conditions initially evoked a transcriptional response that resembled the pattern previously seen in high-light stress, but at later timepoints we observed O2-dependent recovery of photosynthesis-related transcripts. These results suggest that oxygen has a protective role in Prochlorococcus when carbon fixation is not a sufficient sink for light energy.},

This paper characterizes the higher plant 2-Cys-peroxiredoxin BAS1. (i) Escherichia coli over-expressing BAS1 exhibit increased tolerance for alkyl hydroperoxides in vivo. This result substantiates the peroxiredoxin function of BAS1. (ii) BAS1 protein is associated with the soluble chloroplast fraction of mesophyll protoplasts. Import and processing of in vitro-transcribed and cell-free translated BAS1 protein into isolated chloroplasts provides conclusive evidence that the plant-specific N-terminal extension of bas1 encodes the chloroplast import signal which targets the pre-form of BAS1 to the chloroplast stroma where it is cleaved to its mature size. (iii) Genomic analysis reveals that the targeting signal is encoded by a separate exon in Arabidopsis thalina. (iv) The amino acid sequence of the BAS1 core protein of higher plants has a higher degree of similarity to open reading frames in the genome of the bluegreen algae Synechochystis PCC sp. 6803 and in the plastome of the red algae Porphyra purpurea than to any other nuclear-encoded 2-Cys peroxiredoxin. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the chloroplast import signal was added to an ancestor gene of endosymbiotic origin in the course of plant evolution. (v) The bas1 gene expression is regulated under the control of the cellular redox state which is in accordance with the anti-oxidant function of the enzyme. While oxidative stressors increased expression only slightly, antioxidants such as reduced thiols strongly suppressed the transcript level. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the possible physiological functions of BAS1.},

This review examines how fluorescence parameters can be used to evaluate changes in photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry, linear electron flux, and CO2 assimilation in vivo, and outlines the theoretical bases for the use of specific fluorescence parameters. Although fluorescence parameters can be measured easily, many potential problems may arise when they are applied to predict changes in photosynthetic performance. In particular, consideration is given to problems associated with accurate estimation of the PSII operating efficiency measured by fluorescence and its relationship with the rates of linear electron flux and CO2 assimilation. The roles of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching in the determination of changes in PSII operating efficiency are examined. Finally, applications of fluorescence imaging to studies of photosynthetic heterogeneity and the rapid screening of large numbers of plants for perturbations in photosynthesis and associated metabolism are considered.},

Combining field and experimental data we explored the feeding of the copepod and its access to the mixotrophic ciliate, Ophrydium naumanni, in Lake Moreno Oeste (Patagonia, Argentina). Phytoplankton was dominated by nanoflagellates throughout the water column. Ophrydium naumanni, which accumulates much of the chlorophyll a, as do copepodites and adults of B. gracilipes, has a deep distribution during the day, with maximal abundances around 30 m depth. Mouth-part morphology analysis of B. gracilipes indicated that the copepod has an omnivorous diet. Laboratory experiments showed that B. gracilipes could access O. naumanni only when it is offered as a single food item. However, when natural phytoplankton and ciliate assemblages (including O.naumanni) are offered, B. gracilipes did not eat Ophrydium and preyed on the oligotrich, Strombidium viride, and phytoflagellates like Chrysochromulina parva. The range of ingested sizes was broad (3.9\textendash 33 {$\mu$}m of equivalent spherical diameter) but all selected particles were motile ones with distinctive movements, which would enhance the copepod particle detection.},

Most of the species have a distribution confined to the northern/polar area. Chaetoceros neogracilis and Chaetoceros gelidus were the most represented taxa. Strains of C. neogracilis were morphologically similar and shared identical 18S rRNA gene sequences, but belonged to four distinct genetic clades based on 28S rRNA, ITS-1 and ITS-2 phylogenies. Secondary structure prediction revealed that these four clades differ in hemi-compensatory base changes (HCBCs) in paired positions of the ITS-2, suggesting their inability to interbreed. Reproductively isolated C. neogracilis genotypes can thus co-occur in summer phytoplankton communities in the Beaufort Sea. C. neogracilis generally occurred as single cells but also formed short colonies. It is phylogenetically distinct from an Antarctic species, erroneously identified in some previous studies as C. neogracilis, but named here as Chaetoceros sp. This work provides taxonomically validated sequences for 20 Arctic diatom taxa, which will facilitate future metabarcoding studies on phytoplankton in this region.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are marine primary producers that sink in part due to the density of their silica frustules. Sinking of these phytoplankters is crucial for both the biological pump that sequesters carbon to the deep ocean and for the life strategy of the organism. Sinking rates have been previously measured through settling columns, or with fluorimeters or video microscopy arranged perpendicularly to the direction of sinking. These side-view techniques require large volumes of culture, specialized equipment and are difficult to scale up to multiple simultaneous measures for screening. We established a method for parallel, large scale analysis of multiple phytoplankton sinking rates through top-view monitoring of chlorophyll a fluorescence in microtitre well plates. We verified the method through experimental analysis of known factors that influence sinking rates, including exponential versus stationary growth phase in species of different cell sizes; Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335, chain-forming Skeletonema marinoi RO5A and Coscinodiscus radiatus CCMP312. We fit decay curves to an algebraic transform of the decrease in fluorescence signal as cells sank away from the fluorometer detector, and then used minimal mechanistic assumptions to extract a sinking rate (m d-1) using an RStudio script, SinkWORX. We thereby detected significant differences in sinking rates as larger diatom cells sank faster than smaller cells, and cultures in stationary phase sank faster than those in exponential phase. Our sinking rate estimates accord well with literature values from previously established methods. This well plate-based method can operate as a high throughput integrative phenotypic screen for factors that influence sinking rates including macromolecular allocations, nutrient availability or uptake rates, chain-length or cell size, degree of silification and progression through growth stages. Alternately the approach can be used to phenomically screen libraries of mutants.}

Microcystis aeruginosa, the most common freshwater cyanobacterial species, produces the hepatotoxin microcystin, which is a threat to human and environmental health. Blooms also affect the viability of treating and reusing water and cause problems when detritus accumulates in pipe and pumping delivery infrastructure. We proposed the application of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce cyanobacterial cell death. Spectral fingerprinting of phytoplankton into four groups (cyanobacteria, chlorophyta, diatoms, and cryptophyta) allowed for determination of equivalent chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations contributed by photosynthetic pigments, an indicative measure of the photosynthetic activity of each phytoplankton group. This was used to establish the effect of H2O2 addition on phytoplankton in wastewater samples. The lowest H2O2 dose that caused statistically significant exponential decay of phytoplankton groups was approximately 3.0 \texttimes{} 10-3 g H2O2/{$\mu$}g phytoplankton chl-a. At this dose, cyanobacteria and total phytoplankton exhibited a half-life of 2.3 and 4.5 h, respectively. Cyanobacteria decayed at a rate approximately twice that of chlorophyta and diatoms, and the combined chl-a of all phytoplankton groups decreased to negligible levels within 48 h of H2O2 application.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate whether increased phytoplankton growth rates and biomass caused by higher nutrient availability will result in lower oxidative stress in microalgae by reducing effective-light exposure, a process called self-shading. This hypothesis was tested by a 6 d mesocosm experiment carried out at the Zingst Marine Station, Germany (southern Baltic Sea, 8 to 9 psu) in June 2001. Out-door mesocosms filled with 1400 l of natural seawater sieved through a 100 {$\mu$}m plankton net were manipulated by daily additions of nitrate and phosphate (NP treatment), and nitrate, phosphate and silicate (NPSi treatment). Oxidative stress parameters monitored daily were H2O2 concentrations in the seawater and concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase activity and lipoperoxidation products (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS) in the phytoplankton. Chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration, pH and photosynthesis (O2 evolution) were measured throughout the experiment to describe the physiological status of the phytoplankton. Our data suggest that fast growth of nutrient-saturated microalgae strongly limits oxidative stress by self-shading. This was shown by significantly lower SOD and catalase activities in the nutrient treatments than in the control treatment without nutrient additions. No differences were observed between the 2 nutrient treatments (with or without Si), despite higher photosynthetic rates in the diatom-rich mesocosms (NPSi). Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the close relationships between eutrophication, the occurrence of algal blooms and antioxidant activity in microalgae.},

These include poor stability of some probes and/or products that may be subjected to cellular metabolism and lack of specificity in their reactions with oxidants or reductants. Additional problems often arise from undesired reactions of the probes and from their non-homogeneous distribution in the studied system, production of ROS by the probes themselves, perturbation of the systems under investigation by the probes, and artifacts due to the presence of ROS in the reaction medium. The limits imposed by these difficulties on the precise evaluation of the amounts and rates of formation of ROS are discussed critically.},

In the present study, we employed a multiwell plate-based screening method in combination with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to characterize the effect of externally produced 1O2 on the photosynthetic activity of isolated thylakoid membranes and intact Chlorella sorokiniana cells. The results show that the external 1O2 produced by the photosensitization reactions of Rose Bengal damages Photosystem II both in isolated thylakoid membranes and in intact cells in a concentration dependent manner indicating that 1O2 plays a significant role in photodamage of Photosystem II.},

  abstract = {The pathways of carbon flow during photosynthesis and photorespiration by marine microalgae are examined. It is concluded that, although in healthy, exponentially dividing cells of marine phytoplankton the bulk of carbon assimilation is via ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, a significant proportion of carbon fixation may be by {$\beta$}-carboxylation (via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or pyruvate carboxylase). However, such carbon assimilation does not represent a ``C4 pathway'' as found in certain higher plants. The fixation of carbon via {$\beta$}-carboxylation may, however, be a significant route of carbon assimilation in low irradiance environments. Although many microalgae, both marine and freshwater, posses ``C3 biochemistry'', they nonetheless have physiological characteristics resembling those of C4 higher plants. The available evidence suggests that this is a consequence of the operation, in microalgae, of a ``CO2 concentrating mechanism'' which, effectively, suppresses photorespiration. However, the capacity for carrying out photorespiratory carbon metabolism is present in such cells even though photorespiratory activity may be reduced. The limited evidence available suggests that marine microalgae may possess the enzymatic machinery for both the glycolate pathway and, in diatoms at least, the tartronic semialdehyde cycle of photorespiratory carbon metabolism. The possession of a mechanism to accumulate CO2 and suppress photorespiration could confer a competitive advantage under conditions of CO2 limitation and, possibly, under nitrogen limitation.},

In 1993, an area within this region was artificially enriched with a single dose of soluble iron to test whether phytoplankton are physiologically prevented from utilizing the available nutrients by the low natural iron concentrations2,3. Although photosynthesis was stimulated4, the observed lack of a bloom or a significant decrease in nutrient concentrations could not be attributed unequivocally to zooplankton grazing5\textendash 7, further iron limitation or secondary nutrient limitation2,4. In 1995, a second iron-enrichment experiment (IronEx II) was conducted in which the same total dosage of iron was added, but over eight days8. A massive phytoplankton bloom developed, significantly reducing surface-water nutrient and CO2 concentrations8\textendash 10. Here we report in situ measurements of fluorescence during IronEx II, which show that the iron enrichment triggered biophysical alterations of the phytoplankton's photosynthetic apparatus, resulting in increased photosynthetic capacities throughout the experiment and, hence, the observed bloom. These results unequivocally establish physiological limitation of phytoplankton by iron as the cause of the high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll phenomenon in this ocean region.},

Susceptible individuals fall victim to a contagious disease when they encounter others who are already infected. There is a whole class of problems in which two or more species interact that can be formulated mathematically in quite similar ways. What the mathematical models of these processes have in common is that they record changes that take place over time and are described in terms of ordinary differential equations. This is extended to include chaotic dynamics in two different settings. Another illustration is the interplay of excitation and inhibition that is common in any number of living systems. An example is provided by the breaking of a blood vessel, which mobilizes a cascade of enzyme reactions that lead to the formation of a blood clot.

Although non-nitrogen-fixing marine phytoplankton generally exhibit high gene sequence and genomic diversity, gene sequences of natural populations and isolated strains of Crocosphaerawatsonii, one of the two most abundant open ocean unicellular cyanobacteria groups, have been shown to be 98\textendash 100\% identical. The low sequence diversity in Crocosphaera is a dramatic contrast to sympatric species of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, and raises the question of how genome differences can explain observed phenotypic diversity among Crocosphaera strains. Here we show, through whole genome comparisons of two phenotypically different strains, that there are strain-specific sequences in each genome, and numerous genome rearrangements, despite exceptionally low sequence diversity in shared genomic regions. Some of the strain-specific sequences encode functions that explain observed phenotypic differences, such as exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. The pattern of strain-specific sequences distributed throughout the genomes, along with rearrangements in shared sequences is evidence of significant genetic mobility that may be attributed to the hundreds of transposase genes found in both strains. Furthermore, such genetic mobility appears to be the main mechanism of strain divergence in Crocosphaera which do not accumulate DNA microheterogeneity over the vast majority of their genomes. The strain-specific sequences found in this study provide tools for future physiological studies, as well as genetic markers to help determine the relative abundance of phenotypes in natural populations.}

The circadian clock regulates a number of central plant activities, including growth, development, and reproduction, primarily through controlling a substantial proportion of transcriptional activity and protein function. This review examines the roles that alleles of circadian clock genes have played in domestication and improvement of crop plants. The focus here is on three groups of circadian clock genes essential to clock function in Arabidopsis thaliana: PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORs, GIGANTEA, and the evening complex genes EARLY FLOWERING 3, EARLY FLOWERING 4, and LUX ARRHYTHMO. Homologous genes from each group underlie quantitative trait loci that have beneficial influences on key agricultural traits, especially flowering time but also yield, biomass, and biennial growth habit. Emerging insights into circadian clock regulation of other fundamental plant processes, including responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, are discussed to highlight promising avenues for further crop improvement.},

  abstract = {Nitrate reductase (NR) is the first enzyme of the nitrogen reduction pathway in plants, leading to the production of ammonia. However, in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia, atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is directly reduced to ammonia by the bacterial nitrogenase, which questions the role of NR in symbiosis. Next to that, NR is the best-characterized source of nitric oxide (NO) in plants, and NO is known to be produced during the symbiosis. In the present study, we first surveyed the three NR genes (MtNR1, MtNR2, and MtNR3) present in the Medicago truncatula genome and addressed their expression, activity, and potential involvement in NO production during the symbiosis between M. truncatula and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Our results show that MtNR1 and MtNR2 gene expression and activity are correlated with NO production throughout the symbiotic process and that MtNR1 is particularly involved in NO production in mature nodules. Moreover, NRs are involved together with the mitochondrial electron transfer chain in NO production throughout the symbiotic process and energy regeneration in N2-fixing nodules. Using an in vivo NMR spectrometric approach, we show that, in mature nodules, NRs participate also in the regulation of energy state, cytosolic pH, carbon and nitrogen metabolism under both normoxia and hypoxia. These data point to the importance of NR activity for the N2-fixing symbiosis and provide a first explanation of its role in this process.},

By opening the era of an aerobic, oxygen-containing biosphere, they are the true pacemakers of geological and biological evolution. Cyanobacteria must have been among the first organisms to elaborate mechanisms for the detoxification of partially reduced oxygen species including (hydrogen) peroxide. Since there is still an suprising lack of knowledge on the type, role, and mechanism(s) of peroxide-degrading enzymes in these bacteria, all 44 fully or partially sequenced genomes for haem and non-haem catalases and peroxidases have been critically analysed based on well known structure\textendash function relationships of the corresponding oxidoreductases. It is demonstrated that H2O2-dismutating enzymes are mainly represented by bifunctional (haem) catalase\textendash peroxidases and (binuclear) manganese catalases, with the latter being almost exclusively found in diazotrophic species. Several strains even lack a gene that encodes an enzyme with catalase activity. Two groups of peroxidases are found. Genes encoding putative (primordial) haem peroxidases (with homology to corresponding mammalian enzymes) and vanadium-containing iodoperoxidases are found only in a few species, whereas genes encoding peroxiredoxins (1-Cys, 2-Cys, type II, and Q-type) are ubiquitous in cyanobacteria. In addition, {$\sim$}70\% contain NADPH-dependent glutathione peroxidase-like proteins.

  abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems nowadays are under constant pressure, either from recent or historical events. In most systems with increased nutrient supply, submerged macrophytes got replaced by another stable state, dominated by phytoplankton as main primary producer. Yet, reducing the nutrient supply did not yield the aimed goal of restored habitats for submerged macrophytes in systems worldwide. The question arises, why submerged macrophytes do not re-colonize, and if they are actually competitive. Therefore, primary production assays were conducted in               ex-situ               bentho-pelagic mesocosms and compared to the actual ecosystem, a turbid brackish lagoon of the southern Baltic Sea. Mesocosm were either manipulated to be colonized by macrophytes, or stayed phytoplankton dominated. Oxygen evolution was monitored over a period of five months in 5 min (mesocosms) to 10 min (ecosystem) intervals. Surface and depth-integrated production was calculated to analyse seasonal and areal resolved production patterns. It was found that macrophyte mesocosms were more stable, when considering only surface O               2               production. However, calculating depth-integrated production resulted in net-heterotrophy in both shallow mesocosms approaches and the actual ecosystem. This heterotrophy is likely mediated by sediment respiration and POC accumulation in mesocosms, and a low share of productive to respiring water column in the actual ecosystem. Therefore, it seems unlikely that macrophytes will re-settle, as constant net-heterotrophy may allow for high-nutrient turnover at sediment-water interfaces and within the water column, favouring phytoplankton. These results will assist decision makers in developing more effective restoration measures that can mitigate the negative effects of eutrophication on ecosystem function and services.},

Therefore, a CWB data set was analysed regarding changes in phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from 2000 to 2014. It was expected to find imbalances between produced phytoplankton biomass and total nutrient concentrations. Inner CWB were cyanobacteria-dominated and showed up to five times higher chlorophyll a-concentrations compared to outer CWB with similar total phosphorus-concentrations. Phytoplankton tended to be P-limited during spring and N-limited during summer. Phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentrations were even higher during very humid years, which indicated a close coupling of the CWB with their catchment areas. This study suggests that re-mesotrophication efforts need to consider the importance of changed phytoplankton composition and nutrient availabilities.},

Since phytoplankton therefore modify, and to an extent create, their own habitats, established phytoplankton communities can show resistance and resilience to change, including managed changes in nutrient regimes. Phytoplankton blooms and community structures can be predicted from the overall biogeochemical setting and inputs, but restorations may be influenced by the physiological responses of established phytoplankton taxa to nutrient inputs, temperature, second-order changes in illumination and nutrient recycling. In this review we discuss the contributions of phytoplankton ecophysiology to biogeochemical hysteresis and possible effects on community composition in the face of management, conservation or remediation plans.},

Numerous studies have been undertaken to elucidate the enzyme-dependent mechanism of isoniazid activation, and it is well documented that mutations that reduce activity or inactivate the catalase-peroxidase lead to increased levels of isoniazid resistance in M. tuberculosis. Interpretation of the catalytic activities and the effects of mutations upon the action of the enzyme to date have been limited due to the lack of a three-dimensional structure for this enzyme. In order to provide a more accurate model of the three-dimensional structure of the M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase, we have crystallized the enzyme and now report its crystal structure refined to 2.4-\textbackslash AA resolution. The structure reveals new information about dimer assembly and provides information about the location of residues that may play a role in catalysis including candidates for protein-based radical formation. Modeling and computational studies suggest that the binding site for isoniazid is located near the {$\delta$}-meso heme edge rather than in a surface loop structure as currently proposed. The availability of a crystal structure for the M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase also permits structural and functional effects of mutations implicated in causing elevated levels of isoniazid resistance in clinical isolates to be interpreted with improved confidence.},

  abstract = {Southern Ocean primary productivity plays a key role in global ocean biogeochemistry and climate. At the Southern Ocean sea ice edge in coastal McMurdo Sound, we observed simultaneous cobalamin and iron limitation of surface water phytoplankton communities in late Austral summer. Cobalamin is produced only by bacteria and archaea, suggesting phytoplankton\textendash bacterial interactions must play a role in this limitation. To characterize these interactions and investigate the molecular basis of multiple nutrient limitation, we examined transitions in global gene expression over short time scales, induced by shifts in micronutrient availability. Diatoms, the dominant primary producers, exhibited transcriptional patterns indicative of co-occurring iron and cobalamin deprivation. The major contributor to cobalamin biosynthesis gene expression was a gammaproteobacterial population, Oceanospirillaceae ASP10-02a. This group also contributed significantly to metagenomic cobalamin biosynthesis gene abundance throughout Southern Ocean surface waters. Oceanospirillaceae ASP10-02a displayed elevated expression of organic matter acquisition and cell surface attachment-related genes, consistent with a mutualistic relationship in which they are dependent on phytoplankton growth to fuel cobalamin production. Separate bacterial groups, including Methylophaga, appeared to rely on phytoplankton for carbon and energy sources, but displayed gene expression patterns consistent with iron and cobalamin deprivation. This suggests they also compete with phytoplankton and are important cobalamin consumers. Expression patterns of siderophore- related genes offer evidence for bacterial influences on iron availability as well. The nature and degree of this episodic colimitation appear to be mediated by a series of phytoplankton\textendash bacterial interactions in both positive and negative feedback loops.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the synthesis and degradation of nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of a purine or pyrimidine base, a pentose, and a phosphate. Nucleotides are synthesized by two types of metabolic pathways: de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. The former refers to synthesis of purines and pyrimidines from precursor molecules while the latter refers to the conversion of preformed purines and pyrimidines derived from nucleic acid turnover and by addition of ribose-5-phosphate to the base. De novo synthesis of purines is based on the metabolism of one-carbon compounds. The re-utilization of purine bases, after conversion to their respective nucleotides, constitutes salvage pathways. These pathways are particularly important in extrahepatic tissues. Purines arise from the intermediary metabolism of nucleotides and the degradation of polynucleotides. Salvage occurs mainly by the phosphoribosyltransferase reaction. Preformed purines, hypoxanthine, and guanine derived from nucleotide turnover are reutilized by converting them to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanylic acid (GMP) catalyzed by hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). It is noted that HGPRT deficiency causes a severe clinical disorder.},

The enzyme is optimally active at pH 6.6 and at 55 oC. It requires FAD and Mn2+ for its activity. The membrane-bound enzyme is more stable than the solubilized and purified enzyme. After solubilization it gradually loses its activity when kept at 5 oC which can be fully reactivated by freezing and thawing. The Km values for DL-4-hydroxymandelate and FAD are 0.44 mM and 0.038 mM respectively. The enzyme is highly specific for DL-4-hydroxymandelic acid. DL-3,4-Dihydroxymandelic acid competitively inhibited the enzyme reaction. From the Dixon plot the Ki for DL-3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid was calculated to be 1.8 \texttimes{} 10-4 M.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important signaling compound that has recently been identified as a new substrate for several members of the aquaporin superfamily in various organisms. Evidence is emerging about the physiological significance of aquaporin-facilitated H2O2 diffusion. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes current knowledge about aquaporin-facilitated H2O2 diffusion across cellular membranes. It focuses on physicochemical and experimental evidence demonstrating the involvement of aquaporins in the transport of this redox signaling compound and discusses the regulation and structural prerequisites of these channels to transmit this signal. It also provides perspectives about the potential importance of aquaporin-facilitated H2O2 diffusion processes and places this knowledge in the context of the current understanding of transmembrane redox signaling processes. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Specific aquaporin isoforms facilitate the passive diffusion of H2O2 across biological membranes and control H2O2 membrane permeability and signaling in living organisms. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Redox signaling is a very important process regulating the physiology of cells and organisms in a similar way to the well-characterized hormonal and calcium signaling pathways. Efficient transmembrane diffusion of H2O2, a key molecule in the redox signaling network, requires aquaporins and makes these channels important players in this signaling process. Channel-mediated membrane transport allows the fine adjustment of H2O2 levels in the cytoplasm, intracellular organelles, the apoplast, and the extracellular space, which are essential for it to function as a signal molecule.

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) belongs to the reactive oxygen species (ROS), known as oxidants that can react with various cellular targets thereby causing cell damage or even cell death. On the other hand, recent work has demonstrated that H2O2 also functions as a signalling molecule controlling different essential processes in plants and mammals. Because of these opposing functions the cellular level of H2O2 is likely to be subjected to tight regulation via processes involved in production, distribution and removal. Substantial progress has been made exploring the formation and scavenging of H2O2, whereas little is known about how this signal molecule is transported from its site of origin to the place of action or detoxification. From work in yeast and bacteria it is clear that the diffusion of H2O2 across membranes is limited. We have now obtained direct evidence that selected aquaporin homologues from plants and mammals have the capacity to channel H2O2 across membranes. The main focus of this review is (i) to summarize the most recent evidence for a signalling role of H2O2 in various pathways in plants and mammals and (ii) to discuss the relevance of specific transport of H2O2.},

In order to understand the dynamics of this community on ecologically relevant time-scales, we examined the abundance, distribution and cellular characteristics of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, eukaryotic ultraphytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria during two 20-day time-series at 0\textdegree N, 140\textdegree W in the spring and fall of 1992 (JGOFS time-series cruises, TS-I and TS-II). Prochlorococcus was numerically dominant among the autotrophic groups considered, with mean cell concentrations in surface waters on the order of 1.4 \texttimes{} 105 cells ml-1. Synechococcus and ultraphytoplankton abundances were 17\textendash 30-fold lower than those of Prochlorococcus, and heterotrophic bacterial abundances were 5\textendash 7-fold higher (during TS-I and TS-II, respectively). Daily cell abundances for all groups varied by factors of 1.5-2 within each time-series. Depth-integrated Prochlorococcus abundance averaged over each time-series was 25\% lower during TS-II relative to TS-I; ultraphytoplankton abundance was 42\% higher during the same period. Prochlorococcus and ultraphytoplankton both contributed significantly to the estimated total autotrophic biomass; Synechococcus contributed relatively little. Estimated total photosynthetic pico- plus ultraplankton biomass was on average 30\% higher than heterotrophic bacterial biomass. Changes in the fluorescence and light scatter properties of individual Prochlorococcus cells were observed during the passage of a tropical instability wave during TS-II, and are hypothesized to reflect a physiological response among these cells to that event. Examination of bulk properties alone (e.g. cell numbers or total red fluorescence) would not have revealed these physiological changes. Lower bounds for Prochlorococcus-specific growth rates were calculated based on the DNA distributions of these populations at dusk. These rates were maximal at 15 or 30 m depth, where they approached one doubling per day. Changes in Prochlorococcus forward angle light scatter (FALS) from dawn to dusk were well correlated with these estimates of specific growth rate, an observation that allowed us to relate measurements of FALS to cell volume for Prochlorococcus.},

  abstract = {Reef-building corals form symbiotic relationships with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Symbiodinium are genetically and physiologically diverse, and corals may be able to adapt to different environments by altering their dominant Symbiodinium phylotype. Notably, each coral species associates only with specific Symbiodinium phylotypes, and consequently the diversity of symbionts available to the host is limited by the species specificity. Currently, it is widely presumed that species specificity is determined by the combination of cell-surface molecules on the host and symbiont. Here we show experimental evidence supporting a new model to explain at least part of the specificity in coral\textendash Symbiodinium symbiosis. Using the laboratory model Aiptasia\textendash Symbiodinium system, we found that symbiont infectivity is related to cell size; larger Symbiodinium phylotypes are less likely to establish a symbiotic relationship with the host Aiptasia. This size dependency is further supported by experiments where symbionts were replaced by artificial fluorescent microspheres. Finally, experiments using two different coral species demonstrate that our size-dependent-infection model can be expanded to coral\textendash Symbiodinium symbiosis, with the acceptability of large-sized Symbiodinium phylotypes differing between two coral species. Thus the selectivity of the host for symbiont cell size can affect the diversity of symbionts in corals.},

Its simple features, ease of culture and the sequencing of its 13~Mb haploid nuclear genome have promoted this microalga as a new model organism for cell biology. Here, we investigated the quality of genome assemblies of Illumina GAIIx 75~bp paired-end reads from Ostreococcus tauri, thereby also improving the existing assembly and showing the genome to be stably maintained in culture.},

  abstract = {Tiny photosynthetic microorganisms that form the picoplankton (between 0.3 and 3 {$\mu$}m in diameter) are at the base of the food web in many marine ecosystems, and their adaptability to environmental change hinges on standing genetic variation. Although the genomic and phenotypic diversity of the bacterial component of the oceans has been intensively studied, little is known about the genomic and phenotypic diversity within each of the diverse eukaryotic species present. We report the level of genomic diversity in a natural population of Ostreococcus tauri (Chlorophyta, Mamiellophyceae), the smallest photosynthetic eukaryote. Contrary to the expectations of clonal evolution or cryptic species, the spectrum of genomic polymorphism observed suggests a large panmictic population (an effective population size of 1.2 \texttimes{} 107) with pervasive evidence of sexual reproduction. De novo assemblies of low-coverage chromosomes reveal two large candidate mating-type loci with suppressed recombination, whose origin may pre-date the speciation events in the class Mamiellophyceae. This high genetic diversity is associated with large phenotypic differences between strains. Strikingly, resistance of isolates to large double-stranded DNA viruses, which abound in their natural environment, is positively correlated with the size of a single hypervariable chromosome, which contains 44 to 156 kb of strain-specific sequences. Our findings highlight the role of viruses in shaping genome diversity in marine picoeukaryotes.},

We sequenced its 46-Mb nuclear genome, revealing an expansion of protein families that could have participated in adaptation to symbiosis. NC64A exhibits variations in GC content across its genome that correlate with global expression level, average intron size, and codon usage bias. Although Chlorella species have been assumed to be asexual and nonmotile, the NC64A genome encodes all the known meiosis-specific proteins and a subset of proteins found in flagella. We hypothesize that Chlorella might have retained a flagella-derived structure that could be involved in sexual reproduction. Furthermore, a survey of phytohormone pathways in chlorophyte algae identified algal orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling, suggesting that these functions were established prior to the evolution of land plants. We show that the ability of Chlorella to produce chitinous cell walls likely resulted from the capture of metabolic genes by horizontal gene transfer from algal viruses, prokaryotes, or fungi. Analysis of the NC64A genome substantially advances our understanding of the green lineage evolution, including the genomic interplay with viruses and symbiosis between eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the mechanisms of adaptation of life to the extreme environmental conditions encountered in polar regions. Here we present the genome sequence of a unicellular green alga from the division chlorophyta, Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169, which we will hereafter refer to as C-169. This is the first eukaryotic microorganism from a polar environment to have its genome sequenced. RESULTS: The 48.8 Mb genome contained in 20 chromosomes exhibits significant synteny conservation with the chromosomes of its relatives Chlorella variabilis and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The order of the genes is highly reshuffled within synteny blocks, suggesting that intra-chromosomal rearrangements were more prevalent than inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Remarkably, Zepp retrotransposons occur in clusters of nested elements with strictly one cluster per chromosome probably residing at the centromere. Several protein families overrepresented in C. subellipsoidae include proteins involved in lipid metabolism, transporters, cellulose synthases and short alcohol dehydrogenases. Conversely, C-169 lacks proteins that exist in all other sequenced chlorophytes, including components of the glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchoring system, pyruvate phosphate dikinase and the photosystem 1 reaction center subunit N (PsaN). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that some of these gene losses and gains could have contributed to adaptation to low temperatures. Comparison of these genomic features with the adaptive strategies of psychrophilic microbes suggests that prokaryotes and eukaryotes followed comparable evolutionary routes to adapt to cold environments.},

  abstract = {Plant mitochondria differ from their mammalian counterparts in many respects, which are due to the unique and variable surroundings of plant mitochondria. In green leaves, plant mitochondria are surrounded by ample respiratory substrates and abundant molecular oxygen, both resulting from active photosynthesis, while in roots and bulky rhizomes and fruit carbohydrates may be plenty, whereas oxygen levels are falling. Several enzymatic complexes in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) are capable of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation under physiological and pathological conditions. Inherently connected parameters such as the redox state of electron carriers in the ETC, ATP synthase activity and inner mitochondrial membrane potential, when affected by external stimuli, can give rise to ROS formation via complexes I and III, and by reverse electron transport (RET) from complex II. Superoxide radicals produced are quickly scavenged by superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and the resulting H2O2 is detoxified by peroxiredoxin\textendash thioredoxin system or by the enzymes of ascorbate\textendash glutathione cycle, found in the mitochondrial matrix. Arginine-dependent nitric oxide (NO)-releasing activity of enzymatic origin has been detected in plant mitochondria. The molecular identity of the enzyme is not clear but the involvement of mitochondria-localized enzymes responsible for arginine catabolism, arginase and ornithine aminotransferase has been shown in the regulation of NO efflux. Besides direct control by antioxidants, mitochondrial ROS production is tightly controlled by multiple redundant systems affecting inner membrane potential: NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenases, alternative oxidase (AOX), uncoupling proteins, ATP-sensitive K+ channel and a number of matrix and intermembrane enzymes capable of direct electron donation to ETC. NO removal, on the other hand, takes place either by reactions with molecular oxygen or superoxide resulting in peroxynitrite, nitrite or nitrate ions or through interaction with non-symbiotic hemoglobins or glutathione. Mitochondrial ROS and NO production is tightly controlled by multiple redundant systems providing the regulatory mechanism for redox homeostasis and specific ROS/NO signaling.},

  abstract = {The most conspicuous function of plastids is the oxygenic photosynthesis of chloroplasts, yet plastids are super-factories that produce a plethora of compounds that are indispensable for proper plant physiology and development. Given their origins as free-living prokaryotes, it is not surprising that plastids possess their own genomes whose expression is essential to plastid function. This semi-autonomous character of plastids requires the existence of sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that provide reliable communication between them and other cellular compartments. Such intracellular signaling is necessary for coordinating whole-cell responses to constantly varying environmental cues and cellular metabolic needs. This is achieved by plastids acting as receivers and transmitters of specific signals that coordinate expression of the nuclear and plastid genomes according to particular needs. In this review we will consider the so-called retrograde signaling occurring between plastids and nuclei, and between plastids and other organelles. Another important role of the plastid we will discuss is the involvement of plastid signaling in biotic and abiotic stress that, in addition to influencing retrograde signaling, has direct effects on several cellular compartments including the cell wall. We will also review recent evidence pointing to an intriguing function of chloroplasts in regulating intercellular symplasmic transport. Finally, we consider an intriguing yet less widely known aspect of plant biology, chloroplast signaling from the perspective of the entire plant. Thus, accumulating evidence highlights that chloroplasts, with their complex signaling pathways, provide a mechanism for exquisite regulation of plant development, metabolism and responses to the environment. As chloroplast processes are targeted for engineering for improved productivity the effect of such modifications on chloroplast signaling will have to be carefully considered in order to avoid unintended consequences on plant growth and development.},

Our Bayesian molecular clocks, calibrated with microfossils, predict that stem Cyanobacteria arose 3300\textendash 3600 million years ago. Shortly afterwards, we find phylogenetic evidence that ancestral cyanobacteria used SODs with copper and zinc cofactors (CuZnSOD) during the Archaean. By the Paleoproterozoic, they became genetically capable of using iron, nickel, and manganese as cofactors (FeSOD, NiSOD, and MnSOD respectively). The evolution of NiSOD is particularly intriguing because it corresponds with cyanobacteria's invasion of the open ocean. Our analyses of metalloenzymes dealing with reactive oxygen species (ROS) now demonstrate that marine geochemical records alone may not predict patterns of metal usage by phototrophs from freshwater and terrestrial habitats.},

While wide species-to-species variability of cell-normalized H2O2 decay rate coefficients [2 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 8 to 5 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 6 hr\textendash 1 (cell mL\textendash 1)\textendash 1] was observed, these rate coefficients were relatively consistent for a given bacterial species. By contrast, observed production rates (below detection limit to 3 \texttimes{} 102 amol cell\textendash 1 hr\textendash 1) were more variable even for the same species. Variations based on incubation conditions in some bacterial strains suggest that external conditions may impact extracellular H2O2 levels either through increased extracellular production or leakage of intracellular H2O2. Comparison of H2O2 production rates to previously determined superoxide (O2\textendash ) production rates suggests that O2\textendash{} and H2O2 production are not necessarily linked. Rates measured in this study indicate that bacteria could account for a majority of H2O2 decay observed in aqueous systems but likely only make a modest contribution to dark H2O2 production.},

  abstract = {At least three ferritins are found in the bacterium Escherichia coli: the heme-containing bacterioferritin (EcBFR) and two nonheme bacterial ferritins (EcFtnA and EcFtnB). In addition to the conserved A and B sites of the diiron ferroxidase center, EcFtnA has a third iron-binding site (the C site) of unknown function that is nearby the diiron site. In the present work, the complex chemistry of iron oxidation and deposition in EcFtnA was further defined through a combination of oximetry, pH stat, stopped-flow and conventional kinetics, UV\textendash vis, fluorescence, and EPR spectroscopic measurements on both the wild-type protein and site-directed variants of the A, B, and C sites. The data reveal that although H2O2 is a product of dioxygen reduction in EcFtnA and oxidation occurs with a stoichiometry of Fe2+/O2 {$\sim$} 3:1 most of the H2O2 produced is consumed in subsequent reactions with a 2:1 Fe2+/H2O2 stoichiometry, thus suppressing hydroxyl-radical formation. Although the A and B sites are essential for rapid iron oxidation, the C site slows oxidation and suppresses iron turnover at the ferroxidase center. A tyrosyl radical, assigned to Tyr24 near the ferroxidase center, is formed during iron oxidation, and its possible significance to the function of the protein is discussed. Taken as a whole, the data indicate that there are multiple iron-oxidation pathways in EcFtnA with O2 and H2O2 as oxidants. Furthermore, our data do not support a universal mechanism for iron oxidation in all ferritins whereby the C site acts as transit site, as has been recently proposed.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are photosynthetic secondary endosymbionts found throughout marine and freshwater environments, and are believed to be responsible for around one-fifth of the primary productivity on Earth. The genome sequence of the marine centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was recently reported, revealing a wealth of information about diatom biology. Here we report the complete genome sequence of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and compare it with that of T. pseudonana to clarify evolutionary origins, functional significance and ubiquity of these features throughout diatoms. In spite of the fact that the pennate and centric lineages have only been diverging for 90 million years, their genome structures are dramatically different and a substantial fraction of genes ( approximately 40\%) are not shared by these representatives of the two lineages. Analysis of molecular divergence compared with yeasts and metazoans reveals rapid rates of gene diversification in diatoms. Contributing factors include selective gene family expansions, differential losses and gains of genes and introns, and differential mobilization of transposable elements. Most significantly, we document the presence of hundreds of genes from bacteria. More than 300 of these gene transfers are found in both diatoms, attesting to their ancient origins, and many are likely to provide novel possibilities for metabolite management and for perception of environmental signals. These findings go a long way towards explaining the incredible diversity and success of the diatoms in contemporary oceans.},

The enzyme has been found in all aerobic organisms examined where it plays a major role in the defense against toxic-reduced oxygen species, which are generated as byproducts of many biological oxidations. The generation of oxygen radicals can be further exacerbated during environmental adversity and consequently SOD has been proposed to be important for plant stress tolerance. In plants, three forms of the enzyme exist, as classified by their active site metal ion: copper/zinc, manganese, and iron forms. The distribution of these enzymes has been studied both at the subcellular level and at the phylogenic level. It is only in plants that all three different types of SOD coexist. Their occurrence in the different subcellular compartments of plant cells allows a study of their molecular evolution and the possibility of understanding why three functionally equivalent but structurally different types of SOD have been maintained. Several cDNA sequences that encode the different SODs have recently become available, and the use of molecular techniques have greatly increased our knowledge about this enzyme system and about oxidative stress in plants in general, such that now is an appropriate time to review our current knowledge.},

Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends. Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of {$\sim$}1\% of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.},

Multicellularity opens up opportunities for innovations in intercellular communication, cooperation, and specialization, which can provide selective advantages under certain ecological conditions. The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has never had a multicellular ancestor yet it is closely related to the volvocine algae, a clade containing taxa that range from simple unicells to large, specialized multicellular colonies. Simple multicellular structures have been observed to evolve in C. reinhardtii in response to predation or to settling rate-based selection. Structures formed in response to predation consist of individual cells confined within a shared transparent extracellular matrix. Evolved isolates form such structures obligately under culture conditions in which their wild type ancestors do not, indicating that newly-evolved multicellularity is heritable. C. reinhardtii is capable of photosynthesis, and possesses an eyespot and two flagella with which it moves towards or away from light in order to optimize input of radiant energy. Motility contributes to C. reinhardtii fitness because it allows cells or colonies to achieve this optimum. Utilizing phototaxis to assay motility, we determined that newly evolved multicellular strains do not exhibit significant directional movement, even though the flagellae of their constituent unicells are present and active. In C. reinhardtii the first steps towards multicellularity in response to predation appear to result in a trade-off between motility and differential survivorship, a trade-off that must be overcome by further genetic change to ensure long-term success of the new multicellular organism.},

Toxin- and non-toxin-producing species of Pseudo-nitzschia have been reported globally; however, as Pseudo-nitzschia species cannot be routinely identified to species level using light microscopy, cells are rarely recorded to species level during long-term monitoring studies. Here, we report the results of a comparative survey of Pseudo-nitzschia species at two monitoring sites in the North Sea: Stonehaven on the east coast of Scotland and Helgoland Roads in the German Bight. A difference in the seasonality of this genus was observed between the sites with Pseudo-nitzschia cells playing a major role in the spring bloom as well at the summer and autumn diatom community at Stonehaven. In contrast, Pseudo-nitzschia was abundant only during the summer months at Helgoland. Pseudo-nitzschia cells constitute a higher proportion of the diatom community at Stonehaven than at Helgoland, particularly during the late summer, autumn and winter and thus may be considered more `ecologically important' at this site. A total of eight different species were recorded during this survey with five Pseudo-nitzschia species observed at the Helgoland site: P. pungens, P. fraudulenta, P. americana, P. cf. delicatissima and the potentially toxic species P. multiseries. Six species were also recorded at Stonehaven; P. australis, P cf. delicatissima, P. pungens, P. cf. pseudodelicatissima, P. subpacifica and P. seriata. This study represents the first examination of the seasonality of Pseudo-nitzschia species around Helgoland and the first comparison between two long-term monitoring sites in the North Sea.

We examined the effect of iron (Fe) and Fe-light (Fe-L) co-limitation on cellular silica (BSi), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in two marine diatom species, Thalassiosira oceanica and Ditylum brightwellii. We showed that C and N per cell tend to decrease with increasing Fe and Fe-L co-limitation (i.e. decreasing growth rate). We observed an increase (T. oceanica, Fe-L co-limitation), no change (T. oceanica, Fe limitation) and a decrease (D. brightwellii, Fe and Fe-L limitations) in BSi per cell with increasing degree of limitation. When comparing our results to literature data, we noted that the trend in C and N per cell for other Fe limited diatoms was similar to ours. However there was no global trend in BSi, which suggests interspecific differences. The relative variations in C:N, Si:C and Si:N versus the relative variation in specific growth rate (i.e. {$\mu$}:{$\mu$}max) followed the same patterns for both species under Fe and Fe-L co-limitation. The variations of C:N under Fe limitation reported in the literature for other diatoms are contrasted, which may thus be more related to growth conditions than to interspecific differences. Si:C and Si:N ratios increased by more than 2-fold between 100\% and 40\% of {$\mu$}max. Under more severe limitation (Fe or Fe-L), these ratios tend to decrease. To asses the field significance of our results, we compared them to those of artificial Fe fertilisation experiments. This comparison showed that Si:N increased between 100\% and \textasciitilde 40\% of {$\mu$}max, but decreased between 40\% and 20\% of {$\mu$}max, and increased again below 20\% of {$\mu$}max. Between \textasciitilde 15\% and 30\% of {$\mu$}max, Si:N was even lower than under non limiting conditions. These results may have important biogeochemical implications on the understanding and the modeling of the oceanic biogeochemical cycles, e.g. carbon export.},

In addition, in vivo activity of extracellular (eCA) and intracellular (iCA) carbonic anhydrase was determined in relation to CO2 availability. Both species responded to diminishing CO2 supply with an increase in eCA and iCA activity. In P. tricornutum, eCA activity was close to the detection limit at higher CO2 concentrations. Simultaneous uptake of CO2 and HCO3- was observed in both diatoms. At airߚequilibrated CO2 levels (360 ppmv), T. weissflogii took up CO2 and HCO3- at approximately the same rate, whereas CO2 uptake exceeded HCO3- uptake by a factor of two in P. tricornutum. In both diatoms, CO2 :HCO3- uptake ratios progressively decreased with decreasing CO2 concentration, whereas substrate affinities of CO2 and HCO3- uptake increased. Halfߚsaturation concentrations were always {$<$}=5 mM CO2 for CO2 uptake and {$<$}700 mM HCO3- for HCO3- uptake. Our results indicate the presence of highly efficient uptake systems for CO2 and HCO3- in both diatoms at concentrations typically encountered in ocean surface waters and the ability to adjust uptake rates to a wide range of inorganic carbon supply.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

  abstract = {The structure of the picoplankton community in the subtropical Pacific was examined on four depth profiles, one from each season, sampled at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA (22\textdegree 45{${'}$}N, 158\textdegree W). Three cell populations were discriminated by flow cytometry: Prochlorococcus prochlorophytes, Synechococcus cyanobacteria, and picoeukaryotes. Prochlorococcus were the most abundant component (maximum ca 2 \texttimes{} 105 cells ml-1). Unlike previous reports, their concentration was almost constant down to roughly 100 m, with a slight maximum at the surface or near the chlorophyll maximum. Cellular chlorophyll fluorescence increased 50-fold between surface and deep populations. One distinguishing feature of the community off Hawaii was the co-occurrence near the chlorophyll maximum of at least two distinct Prochlorococcus populations with different chlorophyll and DNA contents. Throughout the year, Synechococcus abundance was two orders of magnitude lower and there was no seasonal alteration between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as observed in the northern Sargasso Sea. Synechococcus populations did not extend below 120 m and were dominated by high phycourobilin cell types. Picoeukaryote abundance was quite similar to that of Synechococcus, but these cells extended deeper in the water column. Their chlorophyll fluorescence exhibited much less depth variation than Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus. Seasonal variability was small ({$<$}2- to 3-fold) for all three components of the picoplankton, not only for cell abundance but also for cellular parameters such as light scatter or pigment fluorescence. Synechococcus populations exhibited the largest seasonal changes (e.g. abundance maximum and chlorophyll fluorescence varied 3-fold). Picoplankton community structure in the Pacific Ocean appears to be distinct from previous reports for other areas. In comparing station ALOHA to the Atlantic Ocean (especially the Sargasso Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea, depth-integrated abundances of Prochlorococcus were higher, that of Synechococcus were lower, and that of picoeukaryotes were similar. We believe this structure, dominated by Prochlorococcus, may be typical for subtropical open-ocean regions.},

  abstract = {Many globins convert \textbullet NO to innocuous NO3\textendash{} through their nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) activity. Mycobacterium tuberculosis fights the oxidative and nitrosative stress imposed by its host (the toxic effects of O2\textbullet\textendash{} and \textbullet NO species and their OONO\textendash{} and \textbullet NO2 derivatives) through the action of truncated hemoglobin N (trHbN), which catalyzes the NOD reaction with one of the highest rates among globins. The general NOD mechanism comprises the following steps: binding of O2 to the heme, diffusion of \textbullet NO into the heme pocket and formation of peroxynitrite (OONO\textendash ), isomerization of OONO\textendash, and release of NO3\textendash. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics free-energy calculations, we show that the NOD reaction in trHbN follows a mechanism in which heme-bound OONO\textendash{} undergoes homolytic cleavage to give FeIV=O2\textendash{} and the \textbullet NO2 radical but that these potentially harmful intermediates are short-lived and caged by the heme pocket residues. In particular, the simulations show that Tyr33(B10) side chain is shielded from FeIV=O2\textendash{} and \textbullet NO2 (and protected from irreversible oxidation and nitration) by forming stable hydrogen bonds with Gln58(E11) side chain and Leu54(E7) backbone. Aromatic residues Phe46(CD1), Phe32(B9), and Tyr33(B10) promote NO3\textendash{} dissociation via C\textendash H{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}O bonding and provide stabilizing interactions for the anion along its egress route.},

It works as a security valve in transferring excessive electrons to oxygen, thereby preventing potential damage by the generation of harmful radicals. A clear biological function, besides the stress response, has so far convincingly only been shown for plants that use the alternative oxidase to generate heat to distribute volatiles. In fungi it was described that the alternative oxidase is needed for pathogenicity. Here, we investigate expression and function of the alternative oxidase at different stages of the life cycle of the corn pathogen Ustilago maydis (Aox1). Interestingly, expression of Aox1 is specifically induced during the stationary phase suggesting a role at high cell density when nutrients become limiting. Studying deletion strains as well as overexpressing strains revealed that Aox1 is dispensable for normal growth, for cell morphology, for response to temperature stress as well as for filamentous growth and plant pathogenicity. However, during conditions eliciting respiratory stress yeast-like growth as well as hyphal growth is strongly affected. We conclude that Aox1 is dispensable for the normal biology of the fungus but specifically needed to cope with respiratory stress.},

  abstract = {Adaptation of photosynthesis in marine environment has been examined in two strains of the green, picoeukaryote Ostreococcus: OTH95, a surface/high-light strain, and RCC809, a deep-sea/low-light strain. Differences between the two strains include changes in the light-harvesting capacity, which is lower in OTH95, and in the photoprotection capacity, which is enhanced in OTH95. Furthermore, RCC809 has a reduced maximum rate of O(2) evolution, which is limited by its decreased photosystem I (PSI) level, a possible adaptation to Fe limitation in the open oceans. This decrease is, however, accompanied by a substantial rerouting of the electron flow to establish an H(2)O-to-H(2)O cycle, involving PSII and a potential plastid plastoquinol terminal oxidase. This pathway bypasses electron transfer through the cytochrome b(6)f complex and allows the pumping of "extra" protons into the thylakoid lumen. By promoting the generation of a large DeltapH, it facilitates ATP synthesis and nonphotochemical quenching when RCC809 cells are exposed to excess excitation energy. We propose that the diversion of electrons to oxygen downstream of PSII, but before PSI, reflects a common and compulsory strategy in marine phytoplankton to bypass the constraints imposed by light and/or nutrient limitation and allow successful colonization of the open-ocean marine environment.},

  abstract = {Turbulence is an important determinant of phytoplankton physiology, often leading to cell stress and damage. Turbulence affects phytoplankton migration both by transporting cells and by triggering switches in migratory behavior, whereby vertically migrating cells can actively invert their direction of migration upon exposure to turbulent cues. However, a mechanistic link between single-cell physiology and vertical migration of phytoplankton in turbulence is currently missing. Here, by combining physiological and behavioral experiments with a mathematical model of stress accumulation and dissipation, we show that the mechanism responsible for the switch in the direction of migration in the marine raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo is the integration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling generated by turbulent cues. Within timescales as short as tens of seconds, the emergent downward-migrating subpopulation exhibited a twofold increase in ROS, an indicator of stress, 15\% lower photosynthetic efficiency, and 35\% lower growth rate over multiple generations compared to the upward-migrating subpopulation. The origin of the behavioral split as a result of a bistable oxidative stress response is corroborated by the observation that exposure of cells to exogenous stressors (H2O2, UV-A radiation, or high irradiance), in lieu of turbulence, caused comparable ROS accumulation and an equivalent split into the two subpopulations. By providing a mechanistic link between the single-cell mechanics of swimming and physiology on the one side and the emergent population-scale migratory response and impact on fitness on the other, the ROS-mediated early warning response we discovered contributes to our understanding of phytoplankton community composition in future ocean conditions.},

Currently, microalgae are used in many areas domain like food, feed, bio-remediation, health industry and third generation biofuels. Yet, until now, all cultivated microalgae strains are derived directly from their natural environment. One way of improving productivity is the acquisition of selected algae strains with improved capabilities. In this study, we show that the intra-strain diversity in microalgae can be exploited to produce improved strains. An improved strain with high neutral lipid productivity was obtained, which could be used, for example, for feed or bio-fuels applications. This study also shows the necessity to study and exploit biodiversity within microalgae specie. In addition, we obtained drafts genomes and phenotypic comparisons between the wild-type and the improved clonal strains. These results reflect the origin of intra-strain diversity and microalgae adaptive capacity. The clonal strain selected accumulates more lipids, at the expense of carbohydrates. The numerous patterns of transposable element activity suggest that it is the main driver of this adaptation.},

Over the last 5 decades, a plethora of research has been performed in species ranging from bacteria to mammals that has elucidated the molecular reaction, subcellular location, and specific isoforms of SOD. However, while humans have only begun to study this class of enzymes over the past 50 years, it has been estimated that these enzymes have existed for billions of years, and may be some of the original enzymes found in primitive life. As life evolved over this expanse of time, these enzymes have taken on new and different functional roles potentially in contrast to how they were originally derived. Herein, examination of the evolutionary history of these enzymes provides both an explanation and further inquiries into the modern-day role of SOD in physiology and disease.},

  abstract = {Many organisms activate adaptive transcriptional programs to help them cope with decreased oxygen levels, or hypoxia, in their environment. These responses are triggered by various oxygen sensing systems in bacteria, yeast and metazoans. In metazoans, the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) mediate the adaptive transcriptional response to hypoxia by upregulating genes involved in maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis. The HIFs in turn are regulated by HIF-specific prolyl hydroxlase activity, which is sensitive to cellular oxygen levels and other factors such as tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Establishing a role for ROS in cellular oxygen sensing has been challenging since ROS are intrinsically unstable and difficult to measure. However, recent advances in fluorescence energy transfer resonance (FRET)-based methods for measuring ROS are alleviating some of the previous difficulties associated with dyes and luminescent chemicals. In addition, new genetic models have demonstrated that functional mitochondrial electron transport and associated ROS production during hypoxia are required for HIF stabilization in mammalian cells. Current efforts are directed at how ROS mediate prolyl hydroxylase activity and hypoxic HIF stabilization. Progress in understanding this process has been enhanced by the development of the FRET-based ROS probe, an vivo prolyl hydroxylase reporter and various genetic models harboring mutations in components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.},

A detailed knowledge of their distribution and community composition is particularly important since these organisms are often very delicate and sensitive to change, and can be used as early indicators of environmental change. Natural and man-induced modification of the environment can affect both the distribution and composition of plankton, with important ecological and economic impacts. Marine Plankton provides a practical guide to plankton biology with a large geographic coverage spanning the North Sea to the north-eastern Atlantic coast of the USA and Canada. The book is divided into three sections: an overview of plankton ecology, an assessment of methodology in plankton research covering sampling, preservation, and counting of samples, and a taxonomic guide richly illustrated with detailed line drawings to aid identification. This is an essential reference text suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in marine ecology (particularly useful for fieldwork) as well as for professional marine biologists. It will also be of relevance and use to environmental scientists, conservation biologists, marine resource managers, environmental consultants, and other specialised practitioners.},

Its close interaction with D1 protein has important environmental implications since D1 has been identified as the primary site of damage in endosymbiotic dinoflagellates after thermal stress. We identified and biochemically characterized the PsbO homolog from Symbiodinium kawagutii as a 28-kDa protein, and immunolocalized it to chloroplast membranes. Chloroplast association was further confirmed by western blot on photosynthetic membrane preparations. TX-114 phase partitioning, chromatography, and SDS-PAGE for single band separation and partial peptide sequencing yielded peptides identical or with high identity to PsbO from dinoflagellates. Analysis of a cDNA library revealed three genes differing by only one aminoacid residue in the in silico-translated ORFs despite greater differences at nucleotide level in the untranslated, putative regulatory sequences. The consensus full amino acid sequence displayed all the characteristic domains and features of PsbO from other sources, but changes in functionally critical, highly conserved motifs were detected. Our biochemical, molecular, and immunolocalization data led to the conclusion that the 28-kDa protein from S. kawagutii is the PsbO homolog, thereby named SkPsbO. We discuss the implications of critical amino acid substitutions for a putative regulatory role of this protein.},

Abiotic and biotic stressors also induce the production and temporary accumulation of ROS in plants, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whereby they can act as secondary messengers/chemical mediators in plant defense signaling and lead to programmed cell death. H2O2 acts as a hub for critical information flow in plants. Despite such key roles in fundamental cellular processes, reliable determination of H2O2 levels in plant tissues is hard to achieve. We optimized an Amplex Red-based quantitation method for H2O2 estimation from plant tissue lysate. The standard limit of detection and quantitation was determined as 6 and 18picomol respectively. In this study we also quantified constitutive and/or induced levels of H2O2 in three model plants, Pinus nigra (Austrian pine), Oryza sativa (rice), and Arabidopsis thaliana. Overall, assay sensitivity was in the nmolg-1 FW range. Commonly used additives for H2O2 extraction such as activated charcoal, ammonium sulfate, perchloric acid, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and trichloroacetic acid either degraded H2O2 directly or interfered with the Amplex Red assay. Finally, We measured stability of Amplex Red working solution over one month of storage at -80\textdegree C and found it to be significantly stable over time. With appropriate modifications, this optimized method should be applicable to any plant tissue.},

Nitrate, its main substrate, is required for signaling and is widely distributed in diverse tissues in plants. In addition, NR has been proposed as an important enzymatic source of nitric oxide (NO). Recently, NR has been shown to play a role in NO homeostasis by supplying electrons from NAD(P)H through its diaphorase/dehydrogenase domain both to a truncated hemoglobin THB1, which scavenges NO by its dioxygenase activity, and to the molybdoenzyme NO-forming nitrite reductase (NOFNiR) that is responsible for NO synthesis from nitrite. We review how NR may play a central role in plant biology by controlling the amounts of NO, a key signaling molecule in plant cells.},

For example, water-soluble DNIC [Fe2({$\mu$}-SCH2CH2OH)2(NO)4] (DNIC-1) was explored for oral delivery of NO to the brain and for the activation of hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the kinetics and mechanism for cellular uptake and intracellular release of NO, as well as the biocompatibility of synthetic DNICs, remain elusive. Prompted by the potential application of NO to dermato-physiological regulations, in this study, cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of DNIC [Fe2({$\mu$}-SCH2CH2COOH)2(NO)4] (DNIC-2) and its regulatory effect/biocompatibility toward epidermal cells were investigated. Upon the treatment of DNIC-2 to human fibroblast cells, cellular uptake of DNIC-2 followed by transformation into protein-bound DNICs occur to trigger the intracellular release of NO with a half-life of 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.2 h. As opposed to the burst release of extracellular NO from diethylamine NONOate (DEANO), the cell-penetrating nature of DNIC-2 rationalizes its overwhelming efficacy for intracellular delivery of NO. Moreover, NO-delivery DNIC-2 can regulate cell proliferation, accelerate wound healing, and enhance the deposition of collagen in human fibroblast cells. Based on the in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility evaluation, biocompatible DNIC-2 holds the potential to be a novel active ingredient for skincare products.},

These are the first records of S. marinoi, S. dohrnii and S. subsalsum in China. The Skeletonema-like species, MMDL5067, was isolated from the estuary of the Changjiang River. The morphologic and phylogenetic characteristics of this species do not correspond to those of any previously published Skeletonema species. The intercalary fultoportula processes (IFPPs) have long open tubes, and the intercalary rimoportula process (IRP) is short and located inside the rim of the IFPPs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MMDL5630 clustered with S. tropicum in the NJ and MP trees, but its IRPs differed from those of previously described specimens of S. tropicum. The IRP is partially open, with an elongated opening at the base of the tube, and is longer than the IFPPs. Some specimens of S. marinoi and S. dohrnii also have longer tubular IRPs than the IFPPs. Compared to previously described specimens of S. marinoi and S. dohrnii, these two specimens we identified have shorter IRPs. Our results reflect the ambiguity and diversity of Skeletonema taxonomy.

However, while most reef-building corals harbor Symbiodinium of clade C, Exaiptasia spp. anemones mainly harbor clade B Symbiodinium (ITS2 type B1) populations. In this study, we reveal for the first time that bleached Exaiptasia pallida anemones can establish a symbiotic relationship with a clade C Symbiodinium (ITS2 type C1). We further found that anemones can transmit the exogenously supplied clade C Symbiodinium cells to their offspring by asexual reproduction (pedal laceration). In order to corroborate the establishment of stable symbiosis, we used microscopic techniques and genetic analyses to examine several generations of anemones, and the results of these endeavors confirmed the sustainability of the system. These findings provide a framework for understanding the differences in infection dynamics between homologous and heterologous dinoflagellate types using a model anemone infection system.},

During the last decade, diatoms have begun to be studied intensively using modern molecular techniques and the genomes of four diatoms have been wholly or partially sequenced. Although new insights into the biology and evolution of diatoms are accumulating rapidly due to the availability of reverse genetic tools, the full potential of these molecular biological approaches can only be fully realized if experimental control of sexual crosses becomes firmly established and widely accessible to experimental biologists. Here we discuss the issue of choosing new models for diatom research, by taking into account the broader context of diatom mating systems and the place of sex in relation to the intricate cycle of cell size reduction and restitution that is characteristic of most diatoms. We illustrate the results of our efforts to select and develop experimental systems in diatoms, using species with typical life cycle attributes, which could be used as future model organisms to complement existing ones.

  abstract = {Abiotic stresses like heavy metals, drought, salt, low temperature, etc. are the major factors that limit crop productivity and yield. These stresses are associated with production of certain deleterious chemical entities called reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O2-), hydroxyl radical (OH-), etc. ROS are capable of inducing cellular damage by degradation of proteins, inactivation of enzymes, alterations in the gene and interfere in various pathways of metabolic importance. Our understanding on ROS in response to abiotic stress is revolutionized with the advancements in plant molecular biology, where the basic understanding on chemical behavior of ROS is better understood. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in ROS generation and its potential role during abiotic stress is important to identify means by which plant growth and metabolism can be regulated under acute stress conditions. ROS mediated oxidative stress, which is the key to understand stress related toxicity have been widely studied in many plants and the results in those studies clearly revealed that oxidative stress is the main symptom of toxicity. Plants have their own antioxidant defense mechanisms to encounter ROS that is of enzymic and non-enzymic nature . Coordinated activities of these antioxidants regulate ROS detoxification and reduces oxidative load in plants. Though ROS are always regarded to impart negative impact on plants, some reports consider them to be important in regulating key cellular functions; however, such reports in plant are limited. Molecular approaches to understand ROS metabolism and signaling have opened new avenues to comprehend its critical role in abiotic stress. ROS also acts as secondary messenger that signals key cellular functions like cell proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis. In higher eukaryotes, ROS signaling is not fully understood. In this review we summarize our understanding on ROS and its signaling behavior in plants under abiotic stress.},

  publisher = {{University of British Columbia}},
  doi = {10.14288/1.0371254},
  abstract = {Background: Metabolism-associated kidney stones such as oxalate, uric acid and cystine stones  are caused by over-accumulation or under-excretion of their associated metabolites in the  human body. Although the kidney is the primary excretion site for these metabolites, the  intestine is an important alternative site of excretion. Intestinal bacterial community members  contribute to the breakdown, transport and assimilation of stone-associated metabolites including  oxalate, uric acid, cystine and butyrate. To better diagnose and prevent the formation of  metabolic kidney stones, the intestinal microbiome should be examined at the level of bacterial communities and interconnected metabolic pathways.    Experimental approach: This study examines the differences in bacterial communities and  metabolic pathways between the intestinal microbiomes of recurrent kidney stone patients and  non-stone-forming controls. Fecal samples were collected from 17 recurrent kidney stone  patients and 17 controls with no stone-forming history. Bacterial DNA was then extracted from  the fecal samples. To examine bacterial taxonomy, specific variable regions of the 16S rRNA  gene were sequenced from the DNA and aligned to a bacterial gene database to identify and  quantify the bacteria present. To examine metabolic pathways, metagenomic DNA libraries were  sequenced, assembled and aligned to a metabolic gene database to identify and quantify the  metabolic genes present.    Results: Bacterial populations in patient microbiomes appear to be less diverse than those in  control microbiomes. At the bacterial species level, we found that patient microbiomes had lower  abundance of Oxalobacter formigenes, a well-known oxalate-degrading bacterium. At the  metabolic pathway level, patient microbiomes were found to contain a lower abundance of genes  important for the production of butyrate, a fatty acid that promotes overall intestinal integrity and  has been found to upregulate the expression of oxalate transporters in the gut.    Conclusions: This study verifies previous findings that a majority of recurrent kidney stone  formers lack O. formigenes in their intestinal microbiomes. Additionally, analysis into  metabolic genes in the gut uncovered an additional deficiency in the butyrate metabolism  pathway that could influence overall gut homeostasis. Reduced bacterial diversity in recurrent  stone formers also suggest patient microbiomes may be dysbiotic, a state common to many  intestinal diseases.},

Populations of this picocyanobacterium have been observed below the euphotic zone, but the viability of these cells is unclear. To explore the tolerance of Prochlorococcus to extended light-deprivation, we subjected multiple strains of Prochlorococcus to varying periods of darkness and examined their ability to recover when placed back in the light. Some strains recovered after 35 h of darkness while others could not; this variability was not related to whether the strains were members of high- or low- light adapted ecotypes. The presence of a marine heterotroph, Alteromonas macleodii MIT1002, in the cultures extended their ability to survive prolonged darkness, in the most extreme case by 11 d. This could be attributed at least in part to the reduction of hydrogen peroxide in co-cultures, consistent with known roles of ``helper bacteria'' in detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, and this effect could be mimicked to some degree by the addition of a known hydrogen peroxide quencher, sodium pyruvate. The addition of glucose alone to the cultures provided marginal enhancement, but when both pyruvate and glucose were added together, all strains were able to survive longer in darkness than they were with only the heterotroph added. Thus, it appears that Prochlorococcus dark-survival depends on a multitude of factors. Limited analyses of Synechococcus suggest that its dark-survival capacity is longer than that of Prochlorococcus, for reasons that are not yet clear.},

  abstract = {In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a light-induced oxidative stress shifts the glutathione pool toward its oxidized form, resulting in a translational arrest of the large subunit (LSU) of Rubisco. We show here that the translational arrest of LSU is tightly coordinated with cessation of Rubisco assembly, and both processes take place after a threshold level of reactive oxygen species is reached. As a result, the small subunit is also eliminated by rapid degradation. We previously showed that the amino terminus of the LSU could bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner, as it shares a structural similarity with the RNA recognition motif. This domain becomes exposed only under oxidizing conditions, thus restricting the RNA-binding activity. Here we show that in vitro, thiol groups of both subunits become oxidized in the presence of oxidized glutathione. The structural changes are mediated by oxidized glutathione, whereas only very high concentrations of H2O2 confer similar results in vitro. Changes in the redox state of the LSU thiol groups are also observed in vivo, in response to a physiological light shock caused by transfer of cells from low light to high light. We propose that during a photooxidative stress, oxidation of thiol groups occurs already in nascent LSU chains, perhaps hindering their association with chaperones. As a result, their RNA recognition motif domain becomes exposed and will bind any RNA in its vicinity, including its own transcript. Due to this binding the ribosome stalls, preventing the assembly of additional ribosomes on the transcript. Polysome analysis using Suc gradients indeed shows that the rbcL RNA is associated with the polysomal fraction at all times but shifts toward fractions that contain smaller polysomes and monosomes during oxidative stress. Thus, translational arrest of the LSU most likely occurs at a postinitiation stage.},

Oxidative stress, in particular, the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), play an important role in the development of these diseases, as evidenced by the detection of products of lipid, protein and DNA oxidation in vivo. Even if they participate in cell signaling and metabolism regulation, ROS are also formidable weapons against most of the biological materials because of their intrinsic nature. By nature too, neurons are particularly sensitive to oxidation because of their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, weak antioxidant defense and high oxygen consumption. Thus, the overproduction of ROS in neurons appears as particularly deleterious and the mechanisms involved in oxidative degradation of biomolecules are numerous and complexes. This review highlights the production and regulation of ROS, their chemical properties, both from kinetic and thermodynamic points of view, the links between them, and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases.},

In recent years, the presence of a novel group of enzymes, mainly involved in the metabolism of oxygen free-radicals, has been shown in peroxisomes. In addition to hydrogen peroxide, peroxisomes can generate superoxide-radicals and nitric oxide, which are known cellular messengers with a variety of physiological roles in intra- and inter-cellular communication. Nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide can permeate the peroxisomal membrane and superoxide radicals can be produced on the cytosolic side of the membrane. The signal molecule-generating capacity of peroxisomes can have important implications for cellular metabolism in plants, particularly under biotic and abiotic stress.},

In plants, as in all aerobic organisms, ROS are common by-products formed by the inevitable leakage of electrons onto O2 from the electron transport activities located in chloroplasts, mitochondria, peroxisomes and in plasma membranes or as a consequence of various metabolic pathways confined in different cellular loci. Environmental stresses such as heat, cold, drought, salinity, heavy-metal toxicity, ozone and ultraviolet radiation as well as pathogens/contagion attack lead to enhanced generation of ROS in plants due to disruption of cellular homeostasis. ROS play a dual role in plants; at low concentrations they act as signaling molecules that facilitate several responses in plant cells, including those promoted by biotic and abiotic agents. In divergence, at high levels they cause damage to cellular constituents triggering oxidative stress. In either case, small antioxidant molecules and enzymes modulate the action of these ambivalent species},

  abstract = {The enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) oxidizes L-arginine to NO and citrulline. In this work, we characterise the NOS from the cyanobacteria Synechococcus PCC 7335 (SyNOS). SyNOS possesses a canonical mammalian NOS architecture consisting of oxygenase and reductase domains. In addition, SyNOS possesses an unusual globin domain at the N-terminus. Recombinant SyNOS expressed in bacteria is active, and its activity is suppressed by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME. SyNOS allows E. coli to grow in minimum media containing L-arginine as the sole N source, and has a higher growth rate during N deficiency. SyNOS is expressed in Synechococcus PCC 7335 where NO generation is dependent on L-arginine concentration. The growth of Synechococcus is dramatically inhibited by L-NAME, suggesting that SyNOS is essential for this cyanobacterium. Addition of arginine in Synechococcus increases the phycoerythrin content, an N reservoir. The role of the novel globin domain in SyNOS is discussed as an evolutionary advantage, conferring new functional capabilities for N metabolism.},

  abstract = {Diatoms play a central role in the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, where they represent the main producers and carriers of organic carbon and dissolved silicon towards the deep ocean. Variability in space and time of the size of the most abundant species (Fragilariopsis kerguelensis) may directly impact the way this ecosystem functions, and also affect the nutrient balance of the global ocean, as important water masses (e.g. the Antarctic Intermediate Water) get their nutrient signature in this area. We used a biometric approach and analyzed the size variability of F. kerguelensis valves in sixty-four surface sediment samples from the Southern Ocean, in sediment trap samples from a mooring (Site PF3) at the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), and along a nearby piston core (PS1654-2). The average length and valve area of F. kerguelensis displayed a distinct increase in the proximity of the APF, and lower values to the north and south of it, and also changed markedly over seasonal cycles, as diatom blooms and nutrient availability waxe and wane. The last glacial to interglacial transition also witnesses important changes in the general shape and valve size of F. kerguelensis, with specimens from glacial intervals being ca. 30\% larger than their interglacial counterparts (195 versus 150~{$\mu$}m2 valve area). A sharp peak in average area and a very specific valve morphology correspond to the first signs of deglaciation and concurring SST (Sea Surface Temperature) increase and sea-ice retreat. The latter, together with melting icebergs, may have contributed dissolved iron to surface waters. The highest average sizes during glacial intervals are higher than what found anywhere in the Southern Ocean today. The newly proposed proxy (valve area and shape of F. kerguelensis) may thus prove useful for the reconstruction of the past position and nutrient characteristics of the APF and ``opal belt'', a region characterized by high production and export of biogenic silica, in a particularly sensitive and dynamic area such as the Southern Ocean.},

High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is also included for use in the available software.},

  abstract = {In this review article we examine the role of glutathione reductase in the regulation, modulation and maintenance of cellular redox homoeostasis. Glutathione reductase is responsible for maintaining the supply of reduced glutathione; one of the most abundant reducing thiols in the majority of cells. In its reduced form, glutathione plays key roles in the cellular control of reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species act as intracellular and extracellular signalling molecules and complex cross talk between levels of reactive oxygen species, levels of oxidised and reduced glutathione and other thiols, and antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione reductase determine the most suitable conditions for redox control within a cell or for activation of programmed cell death. Additionally, we discuss the translation and expression of glutathione reductase in a number of organisms including yeast and humans. In yeast and human cells, a single gene expresses more than one form of glutathione reductase, destined for residence in the cytoplasm or for translocation to different organelles; in plants, however, two genes encoding this protein have been described. In general, insects and kinetoplastids (a group of protozoa, including Plasmodia and Trypanosoma) do not express glutathione reductase or glutathione biosynthetic enzymes. Instead, they express either the thioredoxin system or the trypanothione system. The thioredoxin system is also present in organisms that have the glutathione system and there may be overlapping functions with cross-talk between the two systems. Finally we evaluate therapeutic targets to overcome oxidative stress associated cellular disorders.},

Expected end-of-the-century pCO2 (aq) concentrations of 760 \textmu atm (equivalent to pH 7.8) were compared with present-day condition (380 \textmu atm CO2, pH 8.1). Batch culture pH changed rapidly because of CO2 (aq) assimilation and pH targets of 7.8 and 8.1 could not be sustained. Long-term ({$\sim$}100 generation) pH-auxostat, continuous cultures could be maintained at target pH when cell density was kept low ({$<$}2\texttimes 105 cells mL-1). After 3 months continuous culture, the C:N ratio was slightly decreased under high CO2 conditions and red fluorescence per cell was slightly increased. However, no change was detected in photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) or functional cross section of PS II ({$\sigma$}PSII). Elevated pCO2 has been predicted to be beneficial to diatoms due to reduced cost of carbon concentration mechanisms. There was reduced transcription of one putative {$\delta$}-carbonic anhydrase (CA-4) after 3 months growth at increased CO2 but 3 other {$\delta$}-CAs and the small subunit of RUBISCO showed no change. There was no evidence of adaptation or clade selection of T. pseudonana after {$\sim$}100 generations at elevated CO2. On the basis of this long-term culture, pH change of this magnitude in the future ocean may have little effect on T. pseudonana in the absence of genetic adaption.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are single-celled, photosynthetic, bloom-forming algae that are responsible for at least 20\% of global primary production. Nevertheless, more than 30\% of the oceans are considered ``ocean deserts'' due to iron limitation. We used the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model system to explore diatom's response to iron limitation and its interplay with susceptibility to oxidative stress. By analyzing physiological parameters and proteome profiling, we defined two distinct phases: short-term ({$<$}3 d, phase I) and chronic ({$>$}5 d, phase II) iron limitation. While at phase I no significant changes in physiological parameters were observed, molecular markers for iron starvation, such as Iron Starvation Induced Protein and flavodoxin, were highly up-regulated. At phase II, down-regulation of numerous iron-containing proteins was detected in parallel to reduction in growth rate, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, respiration rate, and antioxidant capacity. Intriguingly, while application of oxidative stress to phase I and II iron-limited cells similarly oxidized the reduced glutathione (GSH) pool, phase II iron limitation exhibited transient resistance to oxidative stress, despite the down regulation of many antioxidant proteins. By comparing proteomic profiles of P. tricornutum under iron limitation and metatranscriptomic data of an iron enrichment experiment conducted in the Pacific Ocean, we propose that iron-limited cells in the natural environment resemble the phase II metabolic state. These results provide insights into the trade-off between optimal growth rate and susceptibility to oxidative stress in the response of diatoms to iron quota in the marine environment.},

There is also evidence it may be the tertiary endosymbiont within the ``dinotom'' dinoflagellate Durinskia baltica. A putative strain of N. palea was collected from a pond on the University of Virginia's College at Wise campus and cultured. For initial identification, three markers were sequenced\textemdash nuclear 18S rDNA, the chloroplast 23S rDNA, and rbcL. Morphological characteristics were determined using light and scanning electron microscopy; based on these observations the cells were identified as N. palea and named strain ``Wise.'' DNA from N. palea was deep sequenced and the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes assembled. Single gene phylogenies grouped N. palea\textemdash Wise within a clearly defined N. palea clade and showed it was most closely related to the strain ``SpainA3.'' The chloroplast genome of N. palea is 119,447 bp with a quadripartite structure, 135 protein-coding, 28 tRNA, and 3 rRNA genes. The mitochondrial genome is 37,754 bp with a single repeat region as found in other diatom chondriomes, 37 protein-coding, 23 tRNA, and 2 rRNA genes. The chloroplast genomes of N. palea and D. baltica have identical gene content, synteny, and a 92.7\% pair-wise sequence similarity with most differences occurring in intergenic regions. The N. palea mitochondrial genome and D. baltica's endosymbiont mitochondrial genome also have identical gene content and order with a sequence similarity of 90.7\%. Genome-based phylogenies demonstrated that D. baltica is more similar to N. palea than any other diatom sequence currently available. These data provide the genome sequences of two organelles for a widespread diatom and show they are very similar to those of Durinskia baltica's endosymbiont.},

  abstract = {The presence of potentially toxic diatom species from the genus Pseudo-nitzschia was investigated using net material acquired during several research surveys carried out off the southern, south-western and western coasts of Ireland between 1993 and 1997. Qualitative examination of the phytoplankton net samples using electron microscopy showed that P. pungens, P. multiseries, P. fraudulenta, P. australis, P. delicatissima and P. pseudodelicatissima were regularly present. Two other Pseudo-nitzschia species, tentatively identified as P. seriata (two forms: P. seriata f. seriata and P. seriata f. obtusa) and P. subpacifica, were also observed, though less frequently. Pseudo-nitzschia pungens was relatively abundant in August 1993 and July 1996. Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta was a common component in net samples examined throughout the survey and was predominant in the Pseudo-nitzschia flora in October 1997. Pseudo-nitzschia pseudodelicatissima and P. delicatissima were predominant in many of the net samples taken in July and September 1996.}

  abstract = {Among eukaryotes, four major phytoplankton lineages are responsible for marine photosynthesis; prymnesiophytes, alveolates, stramenopiles, and prasinophytes. Contributions by individual taxa, however, are not well known, and genomes have been analyzed from only the latter two lineages. Tiny ``picoplanktonic'' members of the prymnesiophyte lineage have long been inferred to be ecologically important but remain poorly characterized. Here, we examine pico-prymnesiophyte evolutionary history and ecology using cultivation-independent methods. 18S rRNA gene analysis showed pico-prymnesiophytes belonged to broadly distributed uncultivated taxa. Therefore, we used targeted metagenomics to analyze uncultured pico-prymnesiophytes sorted by flow cytometry from subtropical North Atlantic waters. The data reveal a composite nuclear-encoded gene repertoire with strong green-lineage affiliations, which contrasts with the evolutionary history indicated by the plastid genome. Measured pico-prymnesiophyte growth rates were rapid in this region, resulting in primary production contributions similar to the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. On average, pico-prymnesiophytes formed 25\% of global picophytoplankton biomass, with differing contributions in five biogeographical provinces spanning tropical to subpolar systems. Elements likely contributing to success include high gene density and genes potentially involved in defense and nutrient uptake. Our findings have implications reaching beyond pico-prymnesiophytes, to the prasinophytes and stramenopiles. For example, prevalence of putative Ni-containing superoxide dismutases (SODs), instead of Fe-containing SODs, seems to be a common adaptation among eukaryotic phytoplankton for reducing Fe quotas in low-Fe modern oceans. Moreover, highly mosaic gene repertoires, although compositionally distinct for each major eukaryotic lineage, now seem to be an underlying facet of successful marine phytoplankton.},

Physical separation of the photosensitizer and the bacteria eliminates the possibility of direct interaction between bacteria and photoexcited sensitizers that could lead to Type I (non-singlet oxygen) photooxidation processes. This system was used to examine the bacterial cytotoxicity of singlet oxygen. The role of singlet oxygen was confirmed by measuring the decrease in cytotoxicity as the distance between the singlet oxygen source and the bacteria was increased. The gas phase half-life of the intermediate responsible for cell killing, determined from this distance dependence analysis (24 {$\pm$} 6 ms), is the same as that calculated from literature data for the gas phase half-life of singlet oxygen (53 {$\pm$} 37 ms). Killing of various strains of Salmonella lyphimurium and Escherichia coli was compared at the same dose of singlet oxygen. Bacteria were killed by singlet oxygen at levels several orders of magnitude lower than those effective in killing by H2O2. Altered DNA repair capacities (uvrB, recA, xth, nth, pKM101) did not affect survival. Incomplete cell wall lipopolysaccharide formation decreased survival following singlet oxygen exposure. Overproduction of the singlet oxygen quencher histidine increased survival, as did accumulation of the dipeptide carnosine ({$\beta$}-alanyl-L-histidine). No evidence for mutagenicity of exogenous singlet oxygen exposure was obtained in a variety of S. typhimurium strains killed to 35\% survival.},

Still, the knowledge regarding nanoparticle behavior in a freshwater ecosystem is lacking. The current study focuses on the toxicity of TiO2 NPs towards Ceriodaphnia dubia (a dominant daphnid isolated from the freshwater) under two different conditions; (1) light and dark photoperiod (16:8 h) and (2) continuous dark conditions, for a period of 48 h. An increase in toxicity was observed with an increase in the concentration, until a certain threshold level (under both photoperiod and dark conditions), and beyond which, reduction was noted. The decrease in toxicity would have resulted from the aggregation and settling of NPs, making them less bioavailable. The oxidative stress was one of the major contributors towards cytotoxicity under both photoperiod and dark conditions. The slow depuration of TiO2 NPs under the photoperiod conditions confirmed a higher NP bioaccumulation and thus a higher bioconcentration factor (BCF) compared to dark conditions. The transmission electron micrographs confirmed the bioaccumulation of NPs and damage of tissues in the gut lining.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were initially recognized as toxic by-products of aerobic metabolism. In recent years, it has become apparent that ROS plays an important signaling role in plants, controlling processes such as growth, development and especially response to biotic and abiotic environmental stimuli. The major members of the ROS family include free radicals like O2\ding{108} -, OH\ding{108} and non-radicals like H2O2 and 1O2. The ROS production in plants is mainly localized in the chloroplast, mitochondria and peroxisomes. There are secondary sites as well like the endoplasmic reticulum, cell membrane, cell wall and the apoplast. The role of the ROS family is that of a double edged sword; while they act as secondary messengers in various key physiological phenomena, they also induce oxidative damages under several environmental stress conditions like salinity, drought, cold, heavy metals, UV irradiation etc., when the delicate balance between ROS production and elimination, necessary for normal cellular homeostasis, is disturbed. The cellular damages are manifested in the form of degradation of biomolecules like pigments, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and DNA, which ultimately amalgamate in plant cellular death. To ensure survival, plants have developed efficient antioxidant machinery having two arms, (i) enzymatic components like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR); (ii) non-enzymatic antioxidants like ascorbic acid (AA), reduced glutathione (GSH), {$\alpha$}-tocopherol, carotenoids, flavonoids and the osmolyte proline. These two components work hand in hand to scavenge ROS. In this review, we emphasize on the different types of ROS, their cellular production sites, their targets, and their scavenging mechanism mediated by both the branches of the antioxidant systems, highlighting the potential role of antioxidant},

Nuclear DNA content relates fundamentally to cell volume in other eukaryotic cells. The relationship of cell volume to G1 DNA content was determined among selected members of the genus Thalassiosira, one of the most species-rich and well-studied centric diatom genera. Both minimum and maximum species-specific cell volume correlated positively with G1 DNA content. Phylogeny based on 5.8{$\quad$}S and ITS rDNA sequences indicated that multiple changes in G1 DNA content and cell volume occurred in Thalassiosira evolution, leading to a 1,000-fold range in both parameters in the group. Within the Thalassiosira weissflogii (Grunow) G. A. Fryxell et Grunow species complex, G1 DNA content varied 3-fold: differences related to geographic origin and time since isolation; doubling and tripling of G1 DNA content occurred since isolation in certain T. weissflogii isolates; and subcultures of T. weissflogii CCMP 1336 diverged in DNA content by 50\% within 7{$\quad$}years of separation. Actin, {$\beta$}-tubulin, and Spo11/TopVIA genes were selected for quantitative PCR estimation of haploid genome size in subclones of selected T. weissflogii isolates because they occur only once in the T. pseudonana Hasle et Heimdal genome. Comparison of haploid genome size estimates with G1 DNA content suggested that the most recent T. weissflogii isolate was diploid, whereas other T. weissflogii isolates appeared to be polyploid and/or aneuploid. Aberrant meiotic and mitotic cell divisions were observed, which might relate to polyploidization. The structural flexibility of diatom genomes has important implications for their evolutionary diversification and stability during laboratory maintenance.},

We observed: pairing of parent cells (gametangiogamy); production of four morphologically isogamous, non-flagellated gametes per gametangial pair; rearrangement of the gametes and their fusion to form zygotes, revealing physiological anisogamy; enlargement of auxospores; and formation of long initial cells. Our observations of allogamous reproduction are consistent with those reported for other dioecious pennate diatoms. Clones of P. pseudodeli-catissima from the Black Sea and from the CCMP culture collection failed to auxosporulate when mixed together, although they are the same species according to scanning electron microscopy.

We report here genomic analyses of planktonic microbial communities in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, from the ocean's surface to near-sea floor depths. Sequence variation in microbial community genes reflected vertical zonation of taxonomic groups, functional gene repertoires, and metabolic potential. The distributional patterns of microbial genes suggested depth-variable community trends in carbon and energy metabolism, attachment and motility, gene mobility, and host-viral interactions. Comparative genomic analyses of stratified microbial communities have the potential to provide significant insight into higher-order community organization and dynamics.},

  abstract = {SummaryAim Of the many biological targets of oxidative stress, lipids are the most involved class of biomolecules. Lipid oxidation gives rise to a number of secondary products. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the principal and most studied product of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation. This aldehyde is a highly toxic molecule and should be considered as more than just a marker of lipid peroxidation. Its interaction with DNA and proteins has often been referred to as potentially mutagenic and atherogenic. This review is intended to briefly describe the physiological origin of MDA, to highlight its toxicity, describe and comment on the most recent methods of detection and discuss its occurrence and significance in pathology. Data synthesis In vivo origin as well as reactivity and consequent toxicity of MDA are reviewed. The most recent and improved procedures for the evaluation of MDA in biological fluids are described and discussed. The evidence of the occurrence of increased MDA levels in pathology is described. Conclusions In the assessment of MDA, the most common methods of detection are insufficiently sensitive and disturbed by interference coming from related species or overestimation derived from stressing analysis conditions. Moreover, no recent nutritional or medical trials report the use of one of the new and more reliable methods, some of which are undoubtedly accessible to virtually all the laboratories provided with a common HPLC or a spectrofluorimeter.},

  abstract = {In plant cells, as in most eukaryotic organisms, peroxisomes are probably the major sites of intracellular H2O2 production, as a result of their essentially oxidative type of metabolism. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that peroxisomes carry out essential functions in eukaryotic cells. The generation of the important messenger molecule hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by animal and plant peroxisomes and the presence of catalase in these organelles has been known for many years, but the generation of superoxide radicals (O2{$\cdot$}\textendash ) and the occurrence of the metalloenzyme superoxide dismutase was reported for the first time in peroxisomes from plant origin. Further research showed the presence in plant peroxisomes of a complex battery of antioxidant systems apart from catalase. The evidence available of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in peroxisomes is presented, and the different antioxidant systems characterized in these organelles and their possible functions are described. Peroxisomes appear to have a ROS-mediated role in abiotic stress situations induced by the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) and the xenobiotic 2,4-D, and also in the oxidative reactions of leaf senescence. The toxicity of Cd and 2,4-D has an effect on the ROS metabolism and speed of movement (dynamics) of peroxisomes. The regulation of ROS production in peroxisomes can take place by post-translational modifications of those proteins involved in their production and/or scavenging. In recent years, different studies have been carried out on the proteome of ROS metabolism in peroxisomes. Diverse evidence obtained indicates that peroxisomes are an important cellular source of different signaling molecules, including ROS, involved in distinct processes of high physiological importance, and might play an important role in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis.},

Key plant responses are photoprotection and photoinhibition. In this volume, the dual role of photoprotective responses in the preservation of leaf integrity and in redox signaling networks modulating stress acclimation, growth, and development is addressed. In addition, the still unresolved impact of photoinhibition on plant survival and productivity is discussed. Specific topics include dissipation of excess energy via thermal and other pathways, scavenging of reactive oxygen by antioxidants, proteins key to photoprotection and photoinhibition, peroxidation of lipids, as well as signaling by reactive oxygen, lipid-derived messengers, and other messengers that modulate gene expression. Approaches include biochemical, physiological, genetic, molecular, and field studies, addressing intense visible and ultraviolet light, winter conditions, nutrient deficiency, drought, and salinity.},

DOI: 10.2216/08-98.1.Three raphidophyte species, Chattonella antiqua, C. marina and C. ovata, are red tide\textendash forming harmful phytoplankton species, causing mass mortality at fish farms. These species were originally distinguished from each other solely based on their morphological characters. Recent genetic diversity analyses showed that the three species were extremely similar. It was therefore necessary to re-examine these three species to determine if they were independent single species. We compared 104 strains of the three species using morphological characters, nuclear ITS rDNA regions, the chloroplast rbcL gene, the mitochondrion COI gene and selected microsatellite regions. The morphological characters for the three species formed a continuum of variation instead of clearly defined limits. Compared with other selected heterokontophytes, their genetic divergence in the analyzed three regions was found to be at the intraspecies level. Microsatellite markers distinguished each of the 104 strains, but the strains apparently formed a single geographical population. Based on the morphological characters and the phylogenetic analyses, three groups, corresponding to each of the three Chattonella species, were roughly recognized. Nevertheless, this three-group distribution was insufficient to justify their distinction at the species rank. We therefore proposed a taxonomic revision with C. antiqua and C. ovata reduced to varieties of C. marina, this latter having name priority. We proposed a new status: C. marina var. antiqua (Hada) Demura \& Kawachi and C. marina var. ovata (Y. Hara \& Chihara) Demura \& Kawachi.},

In this study, we unveil the complete genome sequence of an ancient member of this lineage, the unicellular green alga Ostreococcus tauri (Prasinophyceae). This cosmopolitan marine primary producer is the world's smallest free-living eukaryote known to date. Features likely reflecting optimization of environmentally relevant pathways, including resource acquisition, unusual photosynthesis apparatus, and genes potentially involved in C4 photosynthesis, were observed, as was downsizing of many gene families. Overall, the 12.56-Mb nuclear genome has an extremely high gene density, in part because of extensive reduction of intergenic regions and other forms of compaction such as gene fusion. However, the genome is structurally complex. It exhibits previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity for a eukaryote. Two chromosomes differ structurally from the other eighteen. Both have a significantly biased G+C content, and, remarkably, they contain the majority of transposable elements. Many chromosome 2 genes also have unique codon usage and splicing, but phylogenetic analysis and composition do not support alien gene origin. In contrast, most chromosome 19 genes show no similarity to green lineage genes and a large number of them are specialized in cell surface processes. Taken together, the complete genome sequence, unusual features, and downsized gene families, make O. tauri an ideal model system for research on eukaryotic genome evolution, including chromosome specialization and green lineage ancestry.},

In phytoplankton, however, the ecophysiological role(s) of extracellular superoxide production has remained elusive. Here, the mechanism and function of extracellular superoxide production by the marine diatom Thalassiosira oceanica are described. Extracellular superoxide production in T. oceanica exudates was coupled to the oxidation of NADPH. A putative NADPH-oxidizing flavoenzyme with predicted transmembrane domains and high sequence similarity to glutathione reductase (GR) was implicated in this process. GR was also linked to extracellular superoxide production by whole cells via quenching by the flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and oxidized glutathione, the preferred electron acceptor of GR. Extracellular superoxide production followed a typical photosynthesis-irradiance curve and increased by 30\% above the saturation irradiance of photosynthesis, while DPI significantly impaired the efficiency of photosystem II under a wide range of light levels. Together, these results suggest that extracellular superoxide production is a byproduct of a transplasma membrane electron transport system that serves to balance the cellular redox state through the recycling of photosynthetic NADPH. This photoprotective function may be widespread, consistent with the presence of putative homologs to T. oceanica GR in other representative marine phytoplankton and ocean metagenomes. Given predicted climate-driven shifts in global surface ocean light regimes and phytoplankton community-level photoacclimation, these results provide implications for future ocean redox balance, ecological functioning, and coupled biogeochemical transformations of carbon and metals.},

Many phytoplankton taxa also produce extracellular ROS under optimal growth conditions in culture. However, the physiological purpose of extracellular ROS production by phytoplankton and its wider significance to ecosystem-scale trophic interactions and biogeochemistry remain unclear. Here, we review the rates, taxonomic diversity, subcellular mechanisms and functions of extracellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by phytoplankton with a view towards future research directions. Model eukaryotic phytoplankton and cyanobacteria produce extracellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide at cell-normalized rates that span several orders of magnitude, both within and between taxa. The potential ecophysiological roles of extracellular ROS production are versatile and appear to be shared among diverse phytoplankton species, including ichthyotoxicity, allelopathy, growth promotion, and iron acquisition. Whereas extracellular hydrogen peroxide likely arises from a combination of intracellular and cell surface production mechanisms, extracellular superoxide is predominantly generated by specialized systems for transplasma membrane electron transport. Future insights into the molecular-level basis of extracellular ROS production, combined with existing high-sensitivity geochemical techniques for the direct quantification of ROS dynamics, will help unveil the ecophysiological and biogeochemical significance of phytoplankton-derived ROS in natural aquatic systems.},

This study examines the extracellular production of the ROS superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by five marine HAB species: Chattonella marina, Heterosigma akashiwo, Karenia brevis, Pseudo-nitzschia sp. and Aureococcus anophagefferens. All species produced extracellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Rates of ROS production per cell spanned several orders of magnitude and varied inversely with cell density, suggesting a potential signaling role for extracellular ROS. ROS production was also detected in the spent media of all cultures except K. brevis, indicating the presence of cell-free ROS-generating constituents, such as enzymes or metabolites, which could be further investigated as molecular targets for tracking ROS production in laboratory and field settings. Finally, ratios of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide production could not be accounted for by superoxide dismutation alone, except in the case of K. brevis, indicating a diversity of ROS production and degradation pathways that may ultimately help illuminate the functions of HAB-derived ROS.},

By conducting field measurements of superoxide produced by corals during a bleaching event, we show substantial species-specific variation in external superoxide levels, which reflect the balance of production and degradation processes. Extracellular superoxide concentrations are independent of light, algal symbiont abundance and bleaching status, but depend on coral species and bacterial community composition. Furthermore, coral-derived superoxide concentrations ranged from levels below bulk seawater up to {$\sim$}120\,nM, some of the highest superoxide concentrations observed in marine systems.

  abstract = {Photosynthesis is a highly robust process allowing for rapid adjustment to changing environmental conditions. The efficient acclimation depends on balanced redox metabolism and control of reactive oxygen species release which triggers signaling cascades and potentially detrimental oxidation reactions. Thiol peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase type, and ascorbate peroxidases are the main peroxide detoxifying enzymes of the chloroplast. They use different electron donors and are linked to distinct redox networks. In addition, the peroxiredoxins serve functions in redox regulation and retrograde signaling. The complexity of plastid peroxidases is discussed in context of suborganellar localization, substrate preference, metabolic coupling, protein abundance, activity regulation, interactions, signaling functions, and the conditional requirement for high antioxidant capacity. Thus the review provides an opinion on the advantage of linking detoxification of peroxides to different enzymatic systems and implementing mechanisms for their inactivation to enforce signal propagation within and from the chloroplast.},

New examples and practical applications are integrated throughout the revised and updated text, exploring topics in biology, environmental and energy science, and nanotechnology. It also includes new end-of-chapter problems, and purely mathematical topics are now in appendices. Written in a clear and reader-friendly style, the book provides an excellent introduction to the subject for novices while remaining a valuable resource for experts"-- "This text is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in physical chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, bioengineering, polymer and materials science, pharmaceutical chemistry, chemical engineering, and environmental science. Our focus here is on molecular driving forces, which overlaps with--but is not identical to--the subject of thermodynamics. While the power of thermodynamics is its generality, the power of statistical thermodynamics is the insights it gives into microscopic interactions through the enterprise of model-making. A central theme of this book is that making models, even very simple ones, is a route to insight and to understanding how molecules work. A good theory, no matter how complex its mathematics, is usually rooted in some very simple physical idea"--}

However, imbalance between prooxidant and antioxidant defenses in favor of prooxidants results in oxidative stress associated with the oxidative modification of biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Alone or in combination with primary ethiological factors, free radicals are involved in a pathogenesis of more than a hundred diseases. This chapter reviews the basic science of some of the potential sources and characteristics of free radicals, as well as antioxidant enzymes. Special attention is paid to the role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and immunology-mediated inflammatory reaction.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large (\&gt;80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of \&gt;50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 \texttimes{} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80\textendash 90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

Prasinophyte clade VII comprises picoplanktonic algae that are important components of marine phytoplankton communities, particularly in moderately oligotrophic waters. Despite first being cultured in the 1960s, this clade has yet to be formally described. Previous phylogenetic analyses using the 18S rRNA gene divided prasinophyte clade VII into three lineages, termed A, B and C, the latter formed by a single species, Picocystis salinarum, that to date has only been found in saline lakes. Strains from lineages A and B cannot be distinguished by light microscopy and have very similar photosynthetic pigment profiles corresponding to the prasino-2A pigment group. We obtained phenotypic and genetic data on a large set of prasinophyte clade VII culture strains that allowed us to clarify the taxonomy of this important marine group. We describe two novel classes, the Picocystophyceae and the Chloropicophyceae, the latter containing two novel genera, Chloropicon and Chloroparvula, and eight new species of marine picoplanktonic green algae.},

As a result, DHAR regenerates a pool of reduced ascorbate and detoxifies reactive oxygen species (ROS). In previous experiments involving transgenic rice, we observed that overexpression of DHAR enhanced grain yield and biomass. Since the structure of DHAR is not available, the enzymatic mechanism is not well-understood and remains poorly characterized. To elucidate the molecular basis of DHAR catalysis, we determined the crystal structures of DHAR from Oryza sativa L. japonica (OsDHAR) in the native, ascorbate-bound, and GSH-bound forms and refined their resolutions to 1.9, 1.7, and 1.7 \AA, respectively. These complex structures provide the first information regarding the location of the ascorbate and GSH binding sites and their interacting residues. The location of the ascorbate-binding site overlaps with the GSH-binding site, suggesting a ping-pong kinetic mechanism for electron transfer at the common Cys20 active site. Our structural information and mutagenesis data provide useful insights into the reaction mechanism of OsDHAR against ROS-induced oxidative stress in rice.},

H2O2 was decomposed at rates depending on algal species and was proportional to irradiance. The cyanobacterium was affected by H202 at 10 times lower concentrations than green alga and diatom, and a strong light-dependent toxicity enhanced the difference. The inhibition was measured as photosynthetic yield (Fv/Fm) in pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, and was confirmed by changes in minimal fluorescence (F0) and photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Single doses of 0.27 mg L(-1) of H202 caused 50\% inhibition to M. aeruginosa at high irradiance. Such concentration overlaps with the highest levels of 0.34 mg L(-1) observed in natural waters, suggesting that H202 may act as a limiting factor for cyanobacterial growth.},

The genome of P. marinus SS120 is composed of a single circular chromosome of 1,751,080 bp with an average G+C content of 36.4\%. It contains 1,884 predicted protein-coding genes with an average size of 825 bp, a single rRNA operon, and 40 tRNA genes.

It lacks many genes that are involved in photosynthesis, DNA repair, solute uptake, intermediary metabolism, motility, phototaxis, and other functions that are conserved among other cyanobacteria. Systems of signal transduction and environmental stress response show a particularly drastic reduction in the number of components, even taking into account the small size of the SS120 genome. In contrast, housekeeping genes, which encode enzymes of amino acid, nucleotide, cofactor, and cell wall biosynthesis, are all present. Because of its remarkable compactness, the genome of P. marinus SS120 might approximate the minimal gene complement of a photosynthetic organism.},

A large number of different herbicide classes inhibit photosynthesis by binding to the quinone-binding protein, D-1, to prevent photosynthetic electron transfer. Several different types of herbicides apparently cause accumulation of photodynamic porphyrins by inhibiting protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Bipyridyliums and heteropentalenes cause the production of superoxide radicals by energy diversion from photosystem I of photosynthesis. Lipid synthesis is the site of action of a broad array of herbicides used in controlling monocot weeds. Herbicides of several classes apparently act by inhibiting mitosis through direct interaction with tubulin. Several other molecular sites of herbicide action are known. Despite a growing body of knowledge, the exact molecular sites of action of many herbicides are unknown. Some herbicides are known to have more than one site of action. Virtually all knowledge of herbicide structure-activity relationships is semiempirical. In addition to site of action structure-activity relationships, herbicide structure and chemical properties also strongly influence absorption, translocation, bioactivation, and environmental stability. Considering how little is known about all the potential sites of herbicide action, it is unlikely that during the next decade more than a relatively small number of site-specific herbicide structure-activity relationships will be developed.},

Many of the putative sodN sequences retrieved from public domain genomic and metagenomic databases are quite divergent from structurally and functionally characterized Ni-SOD. Structural bioinformatics studies verified that the divergent members of the sodN protein family code for similar three-dimensional structures and identified evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues. Structural and biochemical studies of the N-terminus `Ni-hook' motif coded for by the putative sodN sequences confirmed both Ni (II) ligating and superoxide dismutase activity. Both environmental and organismal genomes expanded the previously noted phylogenetic distribution of sodN, and the sequences form four well-separated clusters, with multiple subclusters. The phylogenetic distribution of sodN suggests that the gene has been acquired via horizontal gene transfer by numerous organisms of diverse phylogenetic background, including both Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes. The presence of sodN correlates with the genomic absence of the gene coding for Fe-SOD, a structurally and evolutionarily distinct isoform of SOD. Given the low levels of Fe found in the marine environment from where many sequences were attained, we suggest that the replacement of Fe-SOD with Ni-SOD may be an evolutionary adaptation to reduce iron requirements.},

We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyse experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene to transcript to protein mappings. The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.},

H. akashiwo abundance increased gradually from the lower estuary to the upper estuary. The dense bloom of H. akashiwo in late May occurred at the temperature of 20.2\textdegree C and salinity of 16.4 psu and its abundance reached to 10.4\texttimes 106 cells L-1. When compared to mid-May, the mean temperature of surface water increased 4.50\textdegree C, while salinity decreased 2.30 psu in late May. Secchi depth values decreased rapidly from the lower to the upper estuary (6.00 m to 0.50 m). It is considered that a rapid increase in temperature, a decrease in salinity, and high nutrient concentrations in combination with low water circulation at the upper estuary were the causes of the bloom of H. akashiwo. Fish mortality or other harmful effects in environment were not observed during the H. akashiwo bloom. But, these events may create a potentially toxic risk for the study area in the future.},

Several diatoms are known to have anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-microbial properties, but the compounds responsible of these activities are often still unknown. The diatom Cylindrotheca closterium showed anti-inflammatory properties inhibiting TNF{$\alpha$} release in human monocytic leukemia cells. In this study, we present the full transcriptome of C. closterium, and used an -omic approach to identify transcripts coding enzymes that can be involved in the synthesis/degradation of anti-inflammatory compounds. This approach allowed to identify phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphatase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3, phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase and violaxanthin de-epoxidase, which are known to be involved in anti-inflammatory compound metabolism. When C. closterium was cultured in silica-starvation conditions, selected as stress condition to potentially trigger the synthesis of bioactive metabolites, anti-inflammatory activity was lost and expression levels of the analyzed transcripts were reduced. These data suggested that the control culturing condition was the most active. This study used for the first time a transcriptomic-guided approach to identify enzymes involved in anti-inflammatory compound metabolism, directing future discoveries of marine natural products in microalgae.},

Genetic engineering of the active site of CcP, along with structural, spectroscopic, and kinetic characterization of the mutant proteins has provided considerable insight into the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide activation, oxygen\textendash oxygen bond cleavage, and formation of the higher-oxidation state intermediates in heme enzymes. The catalytic mechanism involves complex formation between cytochrome c and CcP.

  abstract = {The high extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations generated during pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH-) therapy has been shown to exhibit a high flux into susceptible cancer cells leading to a decrease in clonogenic survival. It is hypothesized that the intracellular H2O2 concentration for susceptibility is independent of cell type and that the variation observed in dosing is associated with differences in the cell-specific overall steady-state intracellular H2O2 concentration values. The steady-state variation in intracellular H2O2 concentration is coupled to a number of cellular specific transport and reaction factors including catalase activity and membrane permeability. Here a lumped-parameter mathematical modeling approach, assuming a catalase-dominant peroxide removal mechanism, is used to calculate intracellular H2O2 concentration for several cell lines. Experimental measurements of critical parameters pertaining to the model are obtained. The cell lines investigated are normal pancreatic cells, H6c7, the pancreatic cancer cell line, MIA PaCa-2 and the glioblastoma cell lines, LN-229, T98G, and U-87; all which vary in susceptibility. The intracellular H2O2 concentration estimates are correlated with the clonogenic surviving fraction for each cell line, in-vitro. The results showed that, despite the fact that the experimental parameters including catalase concentration and plasma membrane permeability demonstrated significant variability across cell lines, the calculated steady-state intracellular to extracellular H2O2 concentration ratio did not vary significantly across cell lines. Thus, the calculated intracellular H2O2 concentration is not unique in characterizing susceptibility. These results imply that, although intracellular H2O2 concentration plays a key role in cellular susceptibility to P-AscH- adjuvant therapy, its overall contribution in a unifying mechanism across cell types is complex.},

During the crash of an E. huxleyi culture induced by viruses intracellular ROS concentrations were generally elevated and reached levels of approximately double those observed in non-infected control cultures. H2O2 concentrations also increased in the media of the infected cultures from background levels of around 130{$\quad$}nM to approximately 580{$\quad$}nM while levels in the controls decreased. These data suggest that oxidative stress is elevated in infected cells. Although the precise mechanism for ROS production was not identified, a traditional defense related oxidative burst was ruled out, as no evidence of a rapid intracellular accumulation of ROS following addition of the virus was found. CPC declined substantially in the infected culture from a healthy 0.6\textendash 0 arbitrary units. Clearly infection disrupted normal photosynthetic processes, which could lead to the production of ROS via interruption of the electron transport chain at the PSII level. Alternatively, ROS may also be a necessary requirement for viral replication in E. huxleyi, possibly due to a link with viral-induced cell death or associated with general death processes.},

  abstract = {Changes in oceanic primary production, linked to changes in the network of global biogeochemical cycles, have profoundly influenced the geochemistry of Earth for over 3 billion years. In the contemporary ocean, photosynthetic carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton leads to formation of {$\sim$}45 gigatons of organic carbon per annum, of which 16 gigatons are exported to the ocean interior. Changes in the magnitude of total and export production can strongly influence atmospheric CO2 levels (and hence climate) on geological time scales, as well as set upper bounds for sustainable fisheries harvest. The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn, affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans.},

Although numerically inferior to cyanobacteria, these organisms are responsible for the majority of the flux of organic matter to higher trophic levels and the ocean interior. Photosynthetic eukaryotes evolved more than 1.5 billion years ago in the Proterozoic oceans. However, it was not until the Mesozoic Era (251 to 65 million years ago) that the three principal phytoplankton clades that would come to dominate the modern seas rose to ecological prominence. In contrast to their pioneering predecessors, the dinoflagellates, coccolithophores, and diatoms all contain plastids derived from an ancestral red alga by secondary symbiosis. Here we examine the geological, geochemical, and biological processes that contributed to the rise of these three, distantly related, phytoplankton groups. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton biomass in the world's oceans amounts to only {$\backsim$}1-2\% of the total global plant carbon, yet these organisms fix between 30 and 50 billion metric tons of carbon annually, which is about 40\% of the total. On geological time scales there is profound evidence of the importance of phytoplankton photosynthesis in biogeochemical cycles. It is generally assumed that present phytoplankton productivity is in a quasi steady-state (on the time scale of decades). However, in a global context, the stability of oceanic photosynthetic processes is dependent on the physical circulation of the upper ocean and is therefore strongly influenced by the atmosphere. The net flux of atmospheric radiation is critical to determining the depth of the upper mixed layer and the vertical fluxes of nutrients. These latter two parameters are keys to determining the intensity, and spatial and temporal distributions of phytoplankton blooms. Atmospheric radiation budgets are not in steady-state. Driven largely by anthropogenic activities in the 20th century, increased levels of IR- absorbing gases such as CO2, CH4 and CFC's and NOx will potentially increase atmospheric temperatures on a global scale. The atmospheric radiation budget can affect phytoplankton photosynthesis directly and indirectly. Increased temperature differences between the continents and oceans have been implicated in higher wind stresses at the ocean margins. Increased wind speeds can lead to higher nutrient fluxes. Throughout most of the central oceans, nitrate concentrations are sub-micromolar and there is strong evidence that the quantum efficiency of Photosystem II is impaired by nutrient stress. Higher nutrient fluxes would lead to both an increase in phytoplankton biomass and higher biomass-specific rates of carbon fixation. However, in the center of the ocean gyres, increased radiative heating could reduce the vertical flux of nutrients to the euphotic zone, and hence lead to a reduction in phytoplankton carbon fixation. Increased desertification in terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased aeolean loadings of essential micronutrients, such as iron. An increased flux of aeolean micronutrients could fertilize nutrient-replete areas of the open ocean with limiting trace elements, thereby stimulating photosynthetic rates. The factors which limit phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis are discussed and examined with regard to potential changes in the Earth climate system which can lead the oceans away from steady-state. While it is difficult to confidently deduce changes in either phytoplankton biomass or photosynthetic rates on decadal time scales, time-series analysis of ocean transparency data suggest long-term trends have occurred in the North Pacific Ocean in the 20th century. However, calculations of net carbon uptake by the oceans resulting from phytoplankton photosynthesis suggest that without a supply of nutrients external to the ocean, carbon fixation in the open ocean is not presently a significant sink for excess atmospheric CO2.},

PTOX is important for plastid development and carotenoid biosynthesis, and its role in photosynthesis is controversially discussed. To analyze PTOX activity in photosynthetic electron transport recombinant purified PTOX fused to the maltose-binding protein was added to photosystem II-enriched membrane fragments. These membrane fragments contain the plastoquinone (PQ) pool as verified by thermoluminescence. Experimental evidence for PTOX oxidizing PQH2 is demonstrated by following chlorophyll fluorescence induction. Addition of PTOX to photosystem II-enriched membrane fragments led to a slower rise, a lower level of the maximal fluorescence and an acceleration of the fluorescence decay. This effect was only observed at low light intensities indicating that PTOX cannot compete efficiently with the reduction of the PQ pool by photosystem II at higher light intensities. PTOX attached tightly to the membranes since it was only partly removable by membrane washings. Divalent cations enhanced the effect of PTOX on chlorophyll fluorescence compared to NaCl most likely because they increase connectivity between photosystem II centers and the size of the PQ pool. Using single turnover flashes, it was shown that the level of reactive oxygen species, generated by PTOX in a side reaction, increased when the spacing between subsequent double flashes was enlarged. This shows that PTOX generates reactive oxygen species under limited substrate availability.},

In this paper the mucilaginous species Thalassiosira diporocyclus, T. mala and T. minuscula were examined in light and electron microscopes, based on material gathered from South Brazilian waters, to record their frustule morphological variability. Some unrecorded findings related to the cribra structure and the cingulum bands are shown. T. mala has central areolae bearing fewer cribral pores than those located in the marginal region. In addition, the valve metrics of T. diporocyclus and T. minuscula are extended in relation to that reported in the current literature. The two species are new records for Brazilian waters, and T. diporocyclus is a new one in the Western Atlantic Ocean.},

After optimizing sample collection methodology, we analyzed a total of 62 stations from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation (including Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans) at three different depths. Sequence and quantitative analyses of the corresponding amplicons showed the presence of high-light (HL) and low-light (LL) Prochlorococcus clades in essentially all 182 samples, with a largely uniform stratification of LL and HL sequences. Synechococcus cross-amplifications were detected by the taxon-specific melting temperatures of the amplicons. Laboratory exposure of Prochlorococcus MED4 (HL) and MIT9313 (LL) strains to organic pollutants (PAHs and organochlorine compounds) showed a decrease of rbcL transcript abundances, and of the rbcL to psbA ratios for both strains. We propose this technique as a convenient assay to evaluate effects of environmental stressors, including pollution, on the oceanic Prochlorococcus photosynthetic function.},

  abstract = {Peroxynitrite is formed by the very fast reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide radicals, a reaction that kinetically competes with other routes that chemically consume or physically sequester the reagents. It can behave either as an endogenous cytotoxin toward host tissues or a cytotoxic effector molecule against invading pathogens, depending on the cellular source and pathophysiological setting. Peroxynitrite is in itself very reactive against a few specific targets that range from efficient detoxification systems, such as peroxiredoxins, to reactions eventually leading to enhanced radical formation (e.g., nitrogen dioxide and carbonate radicals), such as the reaction with carbon dioxide. Thus, the chemical biology of peroxynitrite is dictated by the chemical kinetics of its formation and decay and by the diffusion across membranes of the species involved, including peroxynitrite itself. On the other hand, most durable traces of peroxynitrite passing (such as 3-nitrotyrosine) are derived from radicals formed from peroxynitrite by routes that represent extremely low-yield processes but that have potentially critical biological consequences. Here we have reviewed the chemical kinetics of peroxynitrite as a biochemical transient species in order to estimate its rates of formation and decay and then its steady-state concentration in different intra- or extracellular compartments, trying to provide a quantitative basis for its reactivity; additionally, we have considered diffusion across membranes to locate its possible effects. Finally, we have assessed the most successful attempts to intercept peroxynitrite by pharmacological intervention in their potential to increment the existing biological defenses that routinely deal with this cytotoxin.},

The disappearance of acid or alkali from the mucosal solution of short-circuited tissue was measured with a pH stat while the serosal pH was kept at 7.4. The duodenum rapidly disposed of both acid and alkali; neither property was altered by gassing with N2 while iodoacetate was in the perfusing solutions. Prevention of release of CO2 from the mucosal chamber obliterated the early rapid phase of acid disposal by the mucosa while a similar maneuver in the serosal chamber increased the appearance of serosal acid without altering the rate of acid disposal. Gut sacs of rabbit duodenum in vitro and in vivo showed a positive correlation between acid disposal and the rate of luminal CO2 production. While acid disposal progressively decreased with time for the in vitro gut sacs, the in vivo gut sac showed no fatigue in this respect. Luminal acidification in the Ussing chamber was associated with a profound reduction in short-circuit current (Isc), partially reversible by elevation of the mucosal pH but not by luminal glucose. Our data suggest that acid disposal occurs in part by intraluminal neutralization and in part by diffusion into the mucosa.},

In this sense, it is also unknown if there is a sexual cycle or a resting stage during the life history of this species, two key aspects necessary to understand the life history strategy of this dinoflagellate. To answer these questions, life history and cell cycle studies were performed with the following results: (i) Kryptoperidinium foliaceum has a sexual cycle and in the dinoflagellate strains studied, the binucleate condition is permanent. Sexuality in the host was confirmed by the presence of fusing gamete pairs and planozygotes in clonal cultures (revealing homothallism), but signs of meiosis in the endosymbiont were not observed. The endosymbiont nucleus likely fuses first, because fusing gamete pairs were found to have two dinoflagellate nuclei but only one endosymbiont nucleus. After complete gamete fusion, the planozygotes had apparently normal endosymbiont and dinoflagellate nuclei. (ii) Asexual division studies using flow cytometry showed that the S phase in the endosymbiont (diatom) nucleus starts 6\textendash 8h later than in the host nucleus, but there was no evidence of mitosis in the former. (iii) Sexual and asexual cysts were formed in culture. Neither cysts from natural samples nor those formed in culture exhibited a dormancy period before germination.},

Resulting changes in phytoplankton community structure are expected to have a cascading effect on primary and export production, food web dynamics and the structure of the marine food web as well the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and bio-limiting elements in the sea. A review of current literature indicates cell size and elemental stoichiometry often respond predictably to abiotic conditions and follow biophysical rules that link environmental conditions to growth rates, and growth rates to food web interactions, and consequently to the biogeochemical cycling of elements. This suggests that cell size and elemental stoichiometry are promising ecophysiological traits for modelling and tracking changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to climate change. In turn, these changes are expected to have further impacts on phytoplankton community structure through as yet poorly understood secondary processes associated with trophic dynamics.},

Singlet oxygen from photosystem II could be detected with specific probes in the aqueous phase of isolated thylakoid suspensions and the cytoplasm of high light stressed cells. This indicates that singlet oxygen can stimulate a response farther from its production site than generally believed.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton are an evolutionarily diverse functional group of marine and freshwater organisms. The photosynthetic metabolism of phytoplankton results in the generation of reactive oxygen species, which, if left un-scavenged, can have detrimental cascading effects. Following the Black Queen Hypothesis (Morris et al., 2012), Loss of Function mutations in gene families encoding reactive oxygen detoxification enzymes were explored across phytoplankton taxa of different sizes. It was found that while no examined taxon has completely outsourced superoxide dismutase isoforms, complete absences of genes encoding catalase peroxidase and catalase enzymes, responsible for the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, were noted in the smallest phytoplankton. A potential upper size threshold for the loss of catalase was determined to be 2.4 {$\mu$}m cell diameter. This is likely due to diffusional limitations on larger cells which preclude their participation in community level detoxification of hydrogen peroxide. Indeed, an overall positive correlation between cell size and the total number of genes within the cell genome encoding reactive oxygen detoxification enzymes was determined, but when genes encoding reactive oxygen detoxification enzymes were normalized to genome size, a negative correlation was found with both cell and genome size. Thus, cells with large genomes allocate a smaller fraction of their total genomic resource to reactive oxygen detoxification.},

H(2)O(2) and organic hydroperoxides are reduced by all thiol peroxidases, most efficiently by SecGPxs, whereas fast peroxynitrite reduction is more common in Prxs. Reduction of lipid hydroperoxides is the domain of monomeric GPx4-type enzymes and of some Prxs. The catalysis starts with oxidation of an active-site selenocysteine (U(P)) or cysteine (C(P)). Activation of Cys (Sec) for hydroperoxide reduction in the GPx family is achieved by a typical tetrad composed of Cys (Sec), Asn, Gln, and Trp, whereas a triad of Cys Thr (or Ser) and Arg is the signature of Prx. In many of the CysGPxs and Prxs, a second Cys (C(R)) is required. In these 2-CysGPxs and 2-CysPrxs, the C(P) oxidized to a sulfenic acid forms an intra- or intermolecular disulfide (typical 2-CysPrx) with C(R), before a stepwise regeneration of ground-state enzyme by redoxin-type proteins can proceed. In SecGPxs and sporadically in Prxs, GSH is used as the reductant. Diversity combined with structural variability predestines thiol peroxidases for redox regulation via ROOH sensing and direct or indirect transduction of oxidant signals to specific protein targets.},

Here, we present quantitative niche models for these lineages that assess present and future global abundances and distributions. These niche models are the result of neural network, nonparametric, and parametric analyses, and they rely on {$>$}35,000 discrete observations from all major ocean regions. The models assess cell abundance based on temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but the individual responses to these environmental variables differ for each lineage. The models estimate global biogeographic patterns and seasonal variability of cell abundance, with maxima in the warm oligotrophic gyres of the Indian and the western Pacific Oceans and minima at higher latitudes. The annual mean global abundances of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are 2.9 {$\pm$} 0.1 \texttimes{} 1027 and 7.0 {$\pm$} 0.3 \texttimes{} 1026 cells, respectively. Using projections of sea surface temperature as a result of increased concentration of greenhouse gases at the end of the 21st century, our niche models projected increases in cell numbers of 29\% and 14\% for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, respectively. The changes are geographically uneven but include an increase in area. Thus, our global niche models suggest that oceanic microbial communities will experience complex changes as a result of projected future climate conditions. Because of the high abundances and contributions to primary production of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, these changes may have large impacts on ocean ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {An expected outcome of climate change is intensification of the global water cycle, which magnifies surface water fluxes, and consequently alters salinity patterns. It is therefore important to understand the adaptations and limits of microalgae to survive changing salinities. To this end, we sequenced the 13.5 Mbp genome of the halotolerant green alga Picochlorum SENEW3 (SE3) that was isolated from a brackish water pond subject to large seasonal salinity fluctuations. Picochlorum SE3 encodes 7367 genes, making it one of the smallest and most gene dense eukaryotic genomes known. Comparison with the pico-prasinophyte Ostreococcus tauri, a species with a limited range of salt tolerance, reveals the enrichment of transporters putatively involved in the salt stress response in Picochlorum SE3. Analysis of cultures and the protein complement highlight the metabolic flexibility of Picochlorum SE3 that encodes genes involved in urea metabolism, acetate assimilation and fermentation, acetoin production and glucose uptake, many of which form functional gene clusters. Twenty-four cases of horizontal gene transfer from bacterial sources were found in Picochlorum SE3 with these genes involved in stress adaptation including osmolyte production and growth promotion. Our results identify Picochlorum SE3 as a model for understanding microalgal adaptation to stressful, fluctuating environments.},

We sequenced and analyzed the nuclear genome of multiple Picochlorum isolates (Chlorophyta) to elucidate strategies of environmental adaptation. It was previously found that coordinated gene regulation is involved in adaptation to salinity stress, and here we show that gene gain and loss also play key roles in adaptation. We determined the extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from prokaryotes and their role in the origin of novel functions in the Picochlorum clade. HGT is an ongoing and dynamic process in this algal clade with adaptation being driven by transfer, divergence, and loss. One HGT candidate that is differentially expressed under salinity stress is indolepyruvate decarboxylase that is involved in the production of a plant auxin that mediates bacteria\textendash diatom symbiotic interactions. Large differences in levels of heterozygosity were found in diploid haplotypes among Picochlorum isolates. Biallelic divergence was pronounced in P. oklahomensis (salt plains environment) when compared with its closely related sister taxon Picochlorum SENEW3 (brackish water environment), suggesting a role of diverged alleles in response to environmental stress. Our results elucidate how microbial eukaryotes with limited gene inventories expand habitat range from mesophilic to halophilic through allelic diversity, and with minor but important contributions made by HGT. We also explore how the nature and quality of genome data may impact inference of nuclear ploidy.},

In this study, 2 periods of high primary productivity are compared from data collected in both spring and summer of 1987 and 1988 from the Delaware Estuary (USA). In spring, particulate carbon isotopic compositions (S13C) were the most positive (up to -17 \%o), whereas in summer the values were the most negative (to -32 \%o). Equations calculating the C02 concentrations within algal cells were used to show that growth of phytoplankton, especially in spring, may be limited by the availability of dissolved carbon dioxide, C02(d). An alternative hypothesis for the enrichment of 13C in diatoms from spring blooms includes the possibility that a mechanism for active bicarbonate accumulation is induced during high primary productivity. Similarly, a model is developed for phytoplankton growth during summer with C02(d)i rather than bicarbonate, being the species of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transported across the membrane. The influence of respired C02 on the isotopic composition of total DIC in summer is also calculated to explain the differences in isotopic compositions of particulate carbon. The demand for C02(d) during periods of high primary productivity limits its availability to phytoplankton. This demand could easily be met by the induction of an active transport system for concentrating DIC, which could explain some of the variability in 813C of particulate carbon in estuaries and oceans.},

When each spheroid was cultured in a large volume of medium, frequently renewed, all spheroids eventually reached a dormant phase at a diameter of approximately 3\textendash 4 mm and a population of approximately 106 cells. In the dormant spheroid, newly generated cells at the periphery balanced those lost by necrosis in the center. We propose that this dormant phase is due to a gradual reduction in the ratio of surface area to volume: a size is achieved beyond which there is insufficient surface area for the spheroid to eliminate catabolites and absorb nutrients. Thus, in the face of unlimited space and of new medium, three-dimensional cell populations become self-regulating. This phenomenon contrasts with standard tissue culture in which cell populations, living on a flat plane in two dimensions, will not stop growing in the face of unlimited space and new medium because the ratio of surface area to volume remains constant. These experiments provide a mechanism for our observations in vivo: before vascularization, solid tumors live by simple diffusion as three-dimensional spheroids or ellipsoids. They become dormant at a diameter of only a few millimeters; once vascularized, they are released from this dormant phase and begin exponential growth. Thus, tumor dormancy resulting from absence of angiogenesis in vivo, may operate by the same mechanism responsible for dormancy of spheroids in vitro.},

The amino acid sequence of O. tauri NOS was found to be 45\% similar to that of human NOS. Folding assignment methods showed that O. tauri NOS can fold as the human endothelial NOS isoform. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that O. tauri NOS clusters together with putative NOS sequences of a Synechoccocus sp strain and Physarum polycephalum. This cluster appears as an outgroup of NOS representatives from metazoa. Purified recombinant O. tauri NOS has a Km for the substrate l-Arg of 12 {$\pm$} 5 {$\mu$}M. Escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant O. tauri NOS have increased levels of NO and cell viability. O. tauri cultures in the exponential growth phase produce 3-fold more NOS-dependent NO than do those in the stationary phase. In O. tauri, NO production increases in high intensity light irradiation and upon addition of l-Arg, suggesting a link between NOS activity and microalgal physiology.},

The major sources of H2O2 in cells will only be briefly described as they are already well documented, The production of H2O2 in red blood cells will be described as it is less well known. But, the concentration of H2O2 within cells is more problematic. Intracellular H2O2 concentration has been estimated based on the kinetics of production and elimination, while its determination is technically difficult. Furthermore, compartmentalization and gradients result in its quantitation only as an average. The sources of extracellular H2O2, particularly in plasma, will also be described briefly. The major question addressed here however, is the actual concentration of H2O2 in plasma, which has been studied extensively, but still remains controversial.},

  abstract = {Unicellular cyanobacteria are now recognized as important to the marine N and C cycles in open ocean gyres, yet there are few direct in situ measurements of their activities. Using a high-resolution nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometer (nanoSIMS), single cell N2 and C fixation rates were estimated for unicellular cyanobacteria resembling N2 fixer Crocosphaera watsonii. Crocosphaera watsonii-like cells were observed in the subtropical North Pacific gyre (22\textdegree 45{${'}$} N, 158\textdegree 0{${'}$} W) as 2 different phenotypes: colonial and free-living. Colonies containing 3\textendash 242 cells per colony were observed and cell density in colonies increased with incubation time. Estimated C fixation rates were similarly high in both phenotypes and unexpectedly for unicellular cyanobacteria 85\% of the colonial cells incubated during midday were also enriched in 15N above natural abundance. Highest 15N enrichment and N2 fixation rates were found in cells incubated overnight where up to 64\% of the total daily fixed N in the upper surface waters was attributed to both phenotypes. The colonial cells retained newly fixed C in a sulfur-rich matrix surrounding the cells and often cells of both phenotypes possessed areas ({$<$}1 nm) of enriched 15N and 13C resembling storage granules. The nanoSIMS imaging of the colonial cells also showed evidence for a division of N2 and C fixation activity across the colony where few individual cells ({$<$}34\%) in a given colony were enriched in both 15N and 13C above the colony average. Our results provide new insights into the ecophysiology of unicellular cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Photorespiration is a high-flux pathway that operates alongside carbon assimilation in C3 plants. Because most higher plant species photosynthesize using only the C3 pathway, photorespiration has a major impact on cellular metabolism, particularly under high light, high temperatures, and CO2 or water deficits. Although the functions of photorespiration remain controversial, it is widely accepted that this pathway influences a wide range of processes from bioenergetics, photosystem II function, and carbon metabolism to nitrogen assimilation and respiration. Crucially, the photorespiratory pathway is a major source of H2O2 in photosynthetic cells. Through H2O2 production and pyridine nucleotide interactions, photorespiration makes a key contribution to cellular redox homeostasis. In so doing, it influences multiple signaling pathways, particularly those that govern plant hormonal responses controlling growth, environmental and defense responses, and programmed cell death. The potential influence of photorespiration on cell physiology and fate is thus complex and wide ranging. The genes, pathways, and signaling functions of photorespiration are considered here in the context of whole plant biology, with reference to future challenges and human interventions to diminish photorespiratory flux.},

  abstract = {Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions, in which electrons move from a donor to an acceptor, are the functional heart of photosynthesis. It is not surprising therefore that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in abundance by photosynthesis, providing a plethora of redox signals as well as functioning as essential regulators of energy and metabolic fluxes. Chloroplasts are equipped with an elaborate and multifaceted protective network that allows photosynthesis to function with high productivity even in resource-limited natural environments. This includes numerous antioxidants with overlapping functions that provide enormous flexibility in redox control. ROS are an integral part of the repertoire of chloroplast signals that are transferred to the nucleus to convey essential information concerning redox pressure within the electron transport chain. Current evidence suggests that there is specificity in the gene-expression profiles triggered by the different ROS signals, so that singlet oxygen triggers programs related to over excitation of photosystem (PS) II while superoxide and hydrogen peroxide promote the expression of other suites of genes that may serve to alleviate electron pressure on the reducing side of PSI. Not all chloroplasts are equal in their signaling functions, with some sub-populations appearing to have better contacts/access to the nucleus than others to promote genetic and epigenetic responses. While the concept that light-induced increases in ROS result in damage to PSII and photoinhibition is embedded in the photosynthesis literature, there is little consensus concerning the extent to which such oxidative damage happens in nature. Slowly reversible decreases in photosynthetic capacity are not necessarily the result of light-induced damage to PSII reaction centers.},

Plants produce significant amounts of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of photosynthetic electron transport and metabolism. Such pathways contribute to the compartment-specific redox-regulated signaling systems in plant cells that convey information to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Like the chloroplasts and mitochondria, the apoplast\textendash cell wall compartment makes a significant contribution to the redox signaling network, but unlike these organelles, the apoplast has a low antioxidant-buffering capacity. The respective roles of ROS, low-molecular antioxidants, redox-active proteins, and antioxidant enzymes are considered in relation to the functions of plant hormones such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and auxin, in the composite control of plant growth and defense. Regulation of redox gradients between key compartments in plant cells such as those across the plasma membrane facilitates flexible and multiple faceted opportunities for redox signaling that spans the intracellular and extracellular environments. In conclusion, plants are recognized as masters of the art of redox regulation that use oxidants and antioxidants as flexible integrators of signals from metabolism and the environment. Antioxid.

Plants compartmentalize this elaborate biochemical process within chloroplasts in order to safely harness the power of solar energy and convert it into usable chemical units. Stresses (biotic or abiotic) that challenge the integrity of the plant cell are likely to affect photosynthesis and alter chlorophyll fluorescence. A simple three-step assay was developed to test selected herbicides representative of the known herbicide mechanisms of action and a number of natural phytotoxins to determine their effect on photosynthesis as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence. The most active compounds were those interacting directly with photosynthesis (inhibitors of photosystem I and II), those inhibiting carotenoid synthesis, and those with mechanisms of action generating reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation (uncouplers and inhibitors of protoporphyrinogen oxidase). Other active compounds targeted lipids (very-long-chain fatty acid synthase and removal of cuticular waxes). Therefore, induced chlorophyll fluorescence is a good biomarker to help identify certain herbicide modes of action and their dependence on light for bioactivity.},

Culture experiments with nutrient-enriched seawater performed on Georges Bank and in Woods Hole Harbor (MA, USA) also showed a 13C distinction between fast-growing diatoms with 13C-rich contents and other algae that were depleted in 13C. Zooplankton from central Georges Bank where diatoms are abundant had relatively high {$\delta$}13C values, consistent with an important nutritional role for 13C-rich diatoms. We estimate that a minimum of 40 \% of the carbon present in zooplankton consumers of central Georges Bank is derived from diatoms. Bloom diatoms from the North Atlantic, northeastern Pacific, and the nearshore Gulf of Mexico also had 13C-rich compositions, indicating that diatoms can be a source of 13C-rich carbon in many marine food webs.}

Recent reports that find latitudinal diversity gradients to be reduced or absent in some unicellular organisms and attribute this to their high abundance and dispersal capabilities would suggest that bacteria, the smallest and most abundant organisms, should exhibit no latitudinal pattern of diversity. We used amplified ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) whole-assemblage genetic fingerprinting to quantify species richness in 103 near-surface samples of marine bacterial plankton, taken from tropical to polar in both hemispheres. We found a significant latitudinal gradient in richness. The data can help to evaluate hypotheses about the cause of the gradient. The correlations of richness with latitude and temperature were similarly strong, whereas correlations with parameters relating to productivity (chlorophyll, annual primary productivity, bacterial abundance) and other variables (salinity and distance to shore) were much weaker. Despite the high abundance and potentially high dispersal of bacteria, they exhibit geographic patterns of species diversity that are similar to those seen in other organisms. The latitudinal gradient in marine bacteria supports the hypothesis that the kinetics of metabolism, setting the pace for life, has strong influence on diversity.},

Overproduction of ROS can induce oxidative stress, resulting in cells failing to maintain normal physiological redox-regulated functions. This in turn leads to DNA damage, unregulated cell signaling, change in cell motility, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cancer initiation. There are critical determinants that can affect the generation of ROS. These critical determinants, discussed briefly here, include: size, shape, particle surface, surface positive charges, surface-containing groups, particle dissolution, metal ion release from nanometals and nanometal oxides, UV light activation, aggregation, mode of interaction with cells, inflammation, and pH of the medium.},

  abstract = {Nitrate reductase (NR) is the key enzyme for nitrogen assimilation in plant cells and also works as an important enzymatic source of nitric oxide (NO), which then regulates plant growth and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, how NR activities are finely tuned to modulate these biological processes remain largely unknown. Here we present a SWISSPROT 3D analysis of different NR from plant sources indicating the possible sites of S-nitrosylation, and show some evidence of immunoblottings to S-nitrosated (SNO-) proteins. We also found that S-nitrosylation status of NR is negatively correlated with the enzyme activity. The production of NO via NR in vitro represents only 1\% of its nitrate reduction activity, possibly due to NO generated through NR reaction may deactivate the enzyme by this S-nitrosylation-mediated negative-feedback regulation. NR-mediated NO generation also plays a key role in protecting plants from abiotic stresses through activating antioxidant enzymes and increasing antioxidants. Putative connections between NR S-nitrosylation and NO biosynthesis under pathogen attacks and abiotic stresses are discussed in this Perspective.},

Chromera and Vitrella differ significantly in their physiology, morphology, phylogenetic position and genomic features, but Vitrella has not gained as much attention. Here we describe two types of Vitrella zoosporangia. One contains zoospores surrounded by roughly structured matter, with an intracytoplasmic axoneme predicted to develop into a mature flagellum upon spore release, similarly to Plasmodium microgametes; in the second type, cells concurrently bud off the center of the sporangium, surrounded by smooth matter, and flagella develop extracellularly. This process of budding is reminiscent of microsporogenesis as seen in Toxoplasma. We suggest one (or both) of these processes generates gamete-like flagellate progeny. Based on live staining, fusion of zoospores does occur in cultures of V. brassicaformis. We failed to find an apical structure similar to the pseudoconoid in any life stage. V. brassicaformis may therefore either represent an ancestral state lacking an apical complex or has lost the apical complex secondarily. We propose that the common ancestor of Apicomplexa and ``chrompodellids'' exhibited a complex life cycle, which was reduced in chromerids and colpodellids as dictated by their environment.},

Their abundance and species diversity make these organisms significant contributors to biogeochemical cycles and important components of aquatic ecosystems. Although significant progress has been made in studies of Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) over the last two decades, since the spread of ``omics'' technologies, our current knowledge of the molecular processes and gene regulatory networks that facilitate environmental adaptation remain incomplete. Here, we present a transcriptome analysis of               Fragilaria radians               isolated from Lake Baikal. The resulting assembly contains 27,446 transcripts encoding 21,996 putative proteins. The transcriptome assembly and annotation were coupled with quantitative experiments to search for differentially expressed transcripts between (i) exponential growth phase and dark-acclimated cell cultures, and (ii) those changing expression level during the early response to light treatment in dark-acclimated cells.

  abstract = {Polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUA) have recently been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and possibly reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g., peroxynitrite) in the diatom Skeletonema marinoi (S. marinoi), which produces high amounts of PUA. We now are attempting to acquire better understanding of which reactive molecular species are involved in the oxidative response of S. marinoi to PUA. We used flow cytometry, the dye dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) as the main indicator of ROS (but which is also known to partially detect RNS), and different scavengers and inhibitors of both nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD). Both the scavengers Tempol (for ROS) and uric acid (UA, for peroxynitrite) induced a lower DHR-derived green fluorescence in S. marinoi cells exposed to the PUA, suggesting that both reactive species were produced. When PUA-exposed S. marinoi cells were treated with the NO scavenger 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), an opposite response was observed, with an increase in DHR-derived green fluorescence. A higher DHR-derived green fluorescence was also observed in the presence of sodium tungstate (ST), an inhibitor of NO production via nitrate reductase. In addition, two different SOD inhibitors, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (DETC), had an effect, with DETC inducing the strongest inhibition after 20 min. These results indicate the involvement of O2\textbullet{} generation and SOD activity in H2O2 formation (with downstream ROS generation dependent from H2O2) in response to PUA exposure. This is relevant as it refines the biological impact of PUA and identifies the specific molecules involved in the response. It is speculated that in PUA-exposed S. marinoi cells, beyond a certain threshold of PUA, the intracellular antioxidant system is no longer able to cope with the excess of ROS, thus resulting in the observed accumulation of both O2\textbullet - and H2O2. This might be particularly relevant for population dynamics at sea, during blooms, when cell lysis increases and PUA are released. It can be envisioned that in the final stages of blooms, higher local PUA concentrations accumulate, which in turn induces intracellular ROS generation that ultimately leads to cell death and bloom decay.},

Usually, haplotypes are grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) through clustering, whereby the resulting number of OTUs depends on chosen similarity thresholds. We applied, instead, a phylogenetic approach to infer taxa among 18S rDNA V4-metabarcode haplotypes gathered from 48 time-series samples using the marine planktonic diatoms Chaetoceros and Bacteriastrum as test case. The 73 recovered taxa comprised both solitary haplotypes and polytomies, the latter composed each of a highly abundant, dominant haplotype and one to several minor, peripheral haplotypes. The solitary and dominant haplotypes usually matched reference sequences, enabling species assignation of taxa. We hypothesise that the super-abundance of reads in dominant haplotypes results from the homogenization effect of concerted evolution. Reads of populous peripheral haplotypes and dominant haplotypes show comparable distribution patterns over the sample dates, suggesting that they are part of the same population. Many taxa revealed marked seasonality, with closely related ones generally showing distinct periodicity, whereas others occur year-round. Phylogenies inferred from metabarcode haplotypes enable delineation of biologically meaningful taxa, whereas OTUs resulting from clustering algorithms often deviate markedly from such taxa.},

  abstract = {When cultured on different types of solid media, the marine-fouling diatom Amphora coffeaeformis (Ag.) K\"utz. consistently formed two distinct colonial morphotypes named tight and fuzzy. Tight colonies were comprised mainly of small, morphologically distorted, nonmotile cells, whereas morphologically normal and highly motile cells formed the fuzzy colonies. Cells from tight colonies were less adherent to glass, grew more slowly in liquid media, and had a slightly decreased viability on plates with copper than cells from fuzzy colonies. Whereas the protein profiles of the two types of cells were nearly identical in polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie blue, cells from tight colonies produced a significantly lower amount of a protease-resistant, low Mr polysaccharide or glycoconjugate as detected in silver-stained gels. The frequency of appearance of the fuzzy and tight morphotypes was not influenced by the mode of nutrition or the type of substratum to which the algal cells adhered. However, certain formulations of solid medium and the presence of growth-inhibitory concentrations of copper in agar plates favored the formation of tight colonies. Due to their frequencies and patterns of appearance, it was clear that the two naturally formed morphotypes were not the consequence of spontaneous mutations, genetic rearrangement, or selection of stable natural variants, and we have hypothesized that they were linked to a normal physiological behavior. The tight colonial morphotype was used as a valuable marker to screen for true motility/adhesion mutants within an ultraviolet-mutagenized population of A. coffeaeformis. Seven mutants were isolated that were non-motile on agar plates, poorly adherent to glass, and distinguished from naturally formed cells from tight colonies by their inability to form fuzzy colonies upon subculture on solid media.},

We have investigated the generation of superoxide by Chattonella marina (Subrahman.) Y. Hara et Chihara, a phytoplankton taxon known to produce high levels of this reactive oxygen species, and examined the role of superoxide in the acquisition of iron by this organism. Additionally, a generalized model for iron acquisition by C. marina has been developed, which includes three pathways of iron acquisition from organically complexed iron(III): nondissociative reductive uptake, dissociative reductive uptake, and nonreductive dissociative uptake. The model is shown to be particularly useful in ascertaining the relative importance of these various iron-uptake pathways as a function of solution parameters including concentration and iron-binding strength of the organic ligand and superoxide concentration. Our results suggest that superoxide can participate in the C. marina iron-uptake process when iron is complexed to weak ligands, such as citrate, but plays only a minor role when iron is bound to a strong ligand. It thus appears that facilitation of iron acquisition is not the sole purpose of superoxide production by these organisms.},

  abstract = {Massive phytoplankton blooms develop at the Arctic ice edge, sometimes extending far under the pack ice. An extensive culturing effort was conducted before and during a phytoplankton bloom in Baffin Bay between April and July 2016. Different isolation strategies were applied, including flow cytometry cell sorting, manual single cell pipetting, and serial dilution. Although all three techniques yielded the most common organisms, each technique retrieved specific taxa, highlighting the importance of using several methods to maximize the number and diversity of isolated strains. More than 1,000 cultures were obtained, characterized by 18S rRNA sequencing and optical microscopy, and de-replicated to a subset of 276 strains presented in this work. Strains grouped into 57 phylotypes defined by 100\% 18S rRNA sequence similarity. These phylotypes spread across five divisions: Heterokontophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Haptophyta and Dinophyta. Diatoms were the most abundant group (193 strains), mostly represented by the genera Chaetoceros and Attheya. The genera Baffinella and Pyramimonas were the most abundant non-diatom nanoplankton strains, while Micromonas polaris dominated the picoplankton. Diversity at the class level was higher during the peak of the bloom. Potentially new species were isolated, in particular within the genera Navicula, Nitzschia, Coscinodiscus, Thalassiosira, Pyramimonas, Mantoniella and Isochrysis. Culturing efforts such as this one highlight the unexplored eukaryotic plankton diversity in the Arctic and provide a large number of strains for analyzing physiological and metabolic impacts in this changing environment.},

Using remotely sensed observations and modelled datasets, we study such linkages in the northern Red Sea (NRS) - a typical tropical marine ecosystem. We assess the interannual variability (1998\textendash 2015) of both phytoplankton biomass and phenological indices (timing of bloom initiation, duration and termination) in relation to regional warming. We demonstrate that warmer conditions in the NRS are associated with substantially weaker winter phytoplankton blooms, which initiate later, terminate earlier and are shorter in their overall duration (\textasciitilde{} 4 weeks). These alterations are directly linked with the strength of atmospheric forcing (air-sea heat fluxes) and vertical stratification (mixed layer depth [MLD]). The interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) is found to be a good indicator of phytoplankton abundance, but appears to be less important for predicting bloom timing. These findings suggest that future climate warming scenarios may have a two-fold impact on phytoplankton growth in tropical marine ecosystems: 1) a reduction in phytoplankton abundance and 2) alterations in the timing of seasonal phytoplankton blooms.},

  abstract = {Mitochondria are both a source of ATP and a site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, there is little information on the sites of mitochondrial ROS (mROS) production or the biological role of such mROS in plants. We provide genetic proof that mitochondrial complex II (Complex II) of the electron transport chain contributes to localized mROS that regulates plant stress and defense responses. We identify an Arabidopsis mutant in the Complex II subunit, SDH1-1, through a screen for mutants lacking GSTF8 gene expression in response to salicylic acid (SA). GSTF8 is an early stress-responsive gene whose transcription is induced by biotic and abiotic stresses, and its expression is commonly used as a marker of early stress and defense responses. Transcriptional analysis of this mutant, disrupted in stress responses 1 (dsr1), showed that it had altered SA-mediated gene expression for specific downstream stress and defense genes, and it exhibited increased susceptibility to specific fungal and bacterial pathogens. The dsr1 mutant also showed significantly reduced succinate dehydrogenase activity. Using in vivo fluorescence assays, we demonstrated that root cell ROS production occurred primarily from mitochondria and was lower in the mutant in response to SA. In addition, leaf ROS production was lower in the mutant after avirulent bacterial infection. This mutation, in a conserved region of SDH1-1, is a unique plant mitochondrial mutant that exhibits phenotypes associated with lowered mROS production. It provides critical insights into Complex II function with implications for understanding Complex II's role in mitochondrial diseases across eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) cause significant economic and ecological damage worldwide. Despite considerable efforts, a comprehensive understanding of the factors that promote these blooms has been lacking, because the biochemical pathways that facilitate their dominance relative to other phytoplankton within specific environments have not been identified. Here, biogeochemical measurements showed that the harmful alga Aureococcus anophagefferens outcompeted co-occurring phytoplankton in estuaries with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter and turbidity and low levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. We subsequently sequenced the genome of A. anophagefferens and compared its gene complement with those of six competing phytoplankton species identified through metaproteomics. Using an ecogenomic approach, we specifically focused on gene sets that may facilitate dominance within the environmental conditions present during blooms. A. anophagefferens possesses a larger genome (56 Mbp) and has more genes involved in light harvesting, organic carbon and nitrogen use, and encoding selenium- and metal-requiring enzymes than competing phytoplankton. Genes for the synthesis of microbial deterrents likely permit the proliferation of this species, with reduced mortality losses during blooms. Collectively, these findings suggest that anthropogenic activities resulting in elevated levels of turbidity, organic matter, and metals have opened a niche within coastal ecosystems that ideally suits the unique genetic capacity of A. anophagefferens and thus, has facilitated the proliferation of this and potentially other HABs.},

Replicates of the sample, blank, and three standards were placed into 96-well plates and the chemiluminescence was detected with a microplate luminometer. The method was tested on Trichodesmium erythraeum cultures using two superoxide-specific chemiluminescent probes, MCLA and the closely related compound red-CLA, which emit light at 460 and 610 nm, respectively, in the presence of superoxide. Calibration of the chemiluminescent signal is performed individually for each sample using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system by adding a fixed concentration of xanthine (50 \textmu M) and variable concentrations of xanthine oxidase (0.001\textendash 0.5 units L-1). The method is selective for superoxide, and the detection limits are as low as 1.41 pmol/s for MCLA and 76 fmol s-1 for red-CLA, with limits of quantification of 4.70 pmol/s for MCLA and 253 fmol s-1 for red-CLA. Application of the new method to the determination of extracellular superoxide production by the prolific superoxide-producing phytoplankton Chattonella marina yielded results comparable to those obtained using an existing flow injection analysis method. The use of microplates offers several advantages over existing methods, including a short analysis time of 10 min for triplicates of blank, sample, and standards; good reliability of signals; and use of small sample volumes.},

We investigated the physiological attributes and transcriptional profiles of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown on a day: night cycle under different CO2/pH and iron concentrations, that in combination generated available iron (Fe') concentrations of 1160, 233, 58 and 12 pM. We found the light-dark conditions to be the main driver of transcriptional patterns, followed by Fe' concentration and CO2 availability, respectively. At the highest Fe' (1160 pM), 55\% of the transcribed genes were differentially expressed between day and night, whereas at the lowest Fe' (12 pM), only 28\% of the transcribed genes displayed comparable patterns. While Fe limitation disrupts the diel expression patterns for genes in most central metabolism pathways, the diel expression of light- signaling molecules and glycolytic genes was relatively robust in response to reduced Fe'. Moreover, we identified a non-canonical splicing of transcripts encoding triose-phosphate isomerase, a key-enzyme of glycolysis, generating transcript isoforms that would encode proteins with and without an active site. Transcripts that encoded an active enzyme maintained a diel expression at low Fe', while transcripts that encoded the non-active enzyme lost the diel expression. This work illustrates the interplay between nutrient limitation and transcriptional regulation over the diel cycle. Considering that future ocean conditions will reduce the availability of Fe in many parts of the oceans, our work identifies some of the regulatory mechanisms that may shape future ecological communities.},

However, when overproduced (e.g. due to exogenous stimulation), or when the levels of antioxidants become severely depleted, these reactive species become highly harmful, causing oxidative stress through the oxidation of biomolecules, leading to cellular damage that may become irreversible and cause cell death. The scientific research in the field of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated biological functions and/or deleterious effects is continuously requiring new sensitive and specific tools in order to enable a deeper insight on its action mechanisms. However, reactive species present some characteristics that make them difficult to detect, namely their very short lifetime and the variety of antioxidants existing in vivo, capable of capturing these reactive species. It is, therefore, essential to develop methodologies capable of overcoming this type of obstacles. Fluorescent probes are excellent sensors of ROS due to their high sensitivity, simplicity in data collection, and high spatial resolution in microscopic imaging techniques. Hence, the main goal of the present paper is to review the fluorescence methodologies that have been used for detecting ROS in biological and non-biological media.},

  abstract = {Superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) controls the level of superoxide in the extracellular space by catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. In addition, the enzyme reacts with hydrogen peroxide in a peroxidase reaction which is known to disrupt enzymatic activity. Here, we show that the peroxidase reaction supports a site-specific bond cleavage. Analyses by peptide mapping and mass spectrometry shows that oxidation of Pro112 supports the cleavage of the Pro112-His113 peptide bond. Substitution of Ala for Pro112 did not inhibit fragmentation, indicating that the oxidative fragmentation at this position is dictated by spatial organization and not by side-chain specificity. The major part of EC-SOD inhibited by the peroxidase reaction was not fragmented but found to encompass oxidations of histidine residues involved in the coordination of copper (His98 and His163). These oxidations are likely to support the dissociation of copper from the active site and thus loss of enzymatic activity. Homologous modifications have also been described for the intracellular isozyme, Cu/Zn-SOD, reflecting the almost identical structures of the active site within these enzymes. We speculate that the inactivation of EC-SOD by peroxidase activity plays a role in regulating SOD activity in vivo, as even low levels of superoxide will allow for the peroxidase reaction to occur.},

  abstract = {Three isozymes of superoxide dismutase (SOD) have been identified and characterized. The iron and manganese isozymes (Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD, respectively) show extensive primary sequence and structural homology, suggesting a common evolutionary ancestor. In contrast, the copper/zinc isozyme (CuZn-SOD) shows no homology with Fe-SOD or Mn-SOD, suggesting an independent origin for this enzyme. The three isozymes are unequally distributed throughout the biological kingdoms and are located in different subcellular compartments. Obligate anaerobes and aerobic diazotrophs contain Fe-SOD exclusively. Facultative aerobes contain either Fe-SOD or Mn-SOD or both. Fe-SOD is found in the cytosol of cyanobacteria while the thylakoid membranes of these organisms contain a tightly bound Mn-SOD. Similarly, most eukaryotic algae contain Fe-SOD in the chloroplast stroma and Mn-SOD bound to the thylakoids. Most higher plants contain a cytosol-specific and a chloroplast-specific CuZn-SOD, and possibly a thylakoid-bound Mn-SOD as well. Plants also contain Mn-SOD in their mitochondria. Likewise, animals and fungi contain a cytosolic CuZn-SOD and a mitochondrial Mn-SOD. The Mn-SOD found in the mitochondria of eukaryotes shows strong homology to the prokaryotic form of the enzyme. Taken together, the phylogenetic distribution and subcellular localization of the SOD isozymes provide strong support for the hypothesis that the chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells arose from prokaryotic endosymbionts.},

The abundance of Synechococcus, picophytoeukaryotes and bacterioplankton increased from oligo- to eutrophic conditions, while that of Prochlorococcus decreased according to nutrient availability and hydrographic characteristics. Bacterioplankton dominated across the transect ({$>$} 75\% total picoplanktonic abundance). As expected, Prochlorococcus was the most numerically abundant phytoplankter under very oligotrophic (chlorophyll a concentration {$\leq$}0.1 mg m\textendash 3) and mesotrophic ({$>$} 0.1 and {$\leq$}1 mg m\textendash 3) conditions. However, in contrast to other subtropical regions, picophytoeukaryotes appear to dominate the {$<$} 2 \textmu m autotrophic carbon biomass in this region of the South Pacific Ocean at this time of the year. In the upper 200 m of the water column, the integrated carbon biomass of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picophytoeukaryotes and bacterioplankton were in the ratios of 9:1:14:11 and 3:1:8:6 under oligo- and mesotrophic conditions, respectively. Thus, picophytoeukaryotes were 1.4- to 2-fold higher in biomass than both cyanobacteria combined, and slightly more important (1.2- to 1.3-fold) than bacterioplankton. Picophytoeukaryotes could therefore play a dominant ecological and biogeochemical role in subtropical gyres, which extend over a vast area of the world's oceans.},

Although adsorption of glucose oxidase at the electrode surface and at the polymer|solution interface was shown experimentally, more than 90\% of the amperometric response due to the glucose oxidation was generated by the enzyme confined inside the polymeric matrix. The maximum amperometric response was obtained with a polypyrrole film of thickness 250 nm; the global process rate was governed by the kinetics of the catalysed reaction for thin films and by the mass transport of the species in the polymer for thicker films. All the experimental results were fitted correctly by a complete model using the same values of the physicochemical parameters in all cases. In particular, the theoretical results agreed well with the enzyme location determined experimentally; furthermore, they permitted the prediction that the amperometric response decreased when solution stirring increased. The simulation of the theoretical concentration profiles confirmed that the external mass transport of all species in the solution had to be taken into account and showed that the enzymatic reaction occurred preferentially near the polymer|solution interface. This last result suggested some improvements in the design of the electrode.},

  abstract = {Ferroproteins arose early in Earth's history, prior to the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis and the subsequent reduction of bioavailable iron. Today, iron availability limits primary productivity in about 30\% of the world's oceans. Diatoms, responsible for nearly half of oceanic primary production, have evolved molecular strategies for coping with variable iron concentrations. Our understanding of the evolutionary breadth of these strategies has been restricted by the limited number of species for which molecular sequence data is available. To uncover the diversity of strategies marine diatoms employ to meet cellular iron demands, we analyzed 367 newly released marine microbial eukaryotic transcriptomes, which include 47 diatom species. We focused on genes encoding proteins previously identified as having a role in iron management: iron uptake (high-affinity ferric reductase, multi-copper oxidase, and Fe(III) permease); iron storage (ferritin); iron-induced protein substitutions (flavodoxin/ferredoxin, and plastocyanin/cytochrome c6) and defense against reactive oxygen species (superoxide dismutases). Homologs encoding the high-affinity iron uptake system components were detected across the four diatom Classes suggesting an ancient origin for this pathway. Ferritin transcripts were also detected in all Classes, revealing a more widespread utilization of ferritin throughout diatoms than previously recognized. Flavodoxin and plastocyanin transcripts indicate possible alternative redox metal strategies. Predicted localization signals for ferredoxin identify multiple examples of gene transfer from the plastid to the nuclear genome. Transcripts encoding four superoxide dismutase metalloforms were detected, including a putative nickel-coordinating isozyme. Taken together, our results suggest that the majority of iron metabolism genes in diatoms appear to be vertically inherited with functional diversity achieved via possible neofunctionalization of paralogs. This refined view of iron use strategies in diatoms elucidates the history of these adaptations, and provides potential molecular markers for determining the iron nutritional status of different diatom species in environmental samples.},

Nutrient limitation exerts significant pressure on organisms supporting the trade-off between N cost minimization and increased average mass of amino acids that is a function of increased A+T codon usage. N cost minimization, especially of highly expressed proteins, reduces the total cellular N budget by 2.7\textendash 10\% this minimization in combination with reduction in genome size and cell size is an evolutionary adaptation to nutrient limitation. The biogeochemical and evolutionary precedent for these findings suggests that N limitation is a stronger selective force in the ocean than biosynthetic costs and is an important evolutionary strategy in resource-limited ecosystems.},

In order to better characterize this ecologically important group, we compared the phylogenetic diversity of picoplanktonic prasinophyte strains available at the Roscoff Culture Collection (RCC) and that of nuclear SSU rDNA sequences from environmental clone libraries obtained from oceanic and coastal ecosystems. Among the 570 strains avalaible, 91 belonged to prasinophytes, 65 were partially sequenced, and we obtained the entire SSU rDNA sequence for a selection of 14 strains. Within the 18 available environmental clone libraries, the prasinophytes accounted for 12\% of the total number of clones retrieved (142 partial sequences in total), and we selected 9 clones to obtain entire SSU rDNA sequence. Using this approach, we obtained a subsequent genetic database that revealed the presence of seven independent lineages among prasinophytes, including a novel clade (clade VII). This new clade groups the genus Picocystis, two unidentified coccoid strains, and 4 environmental sequences. For each of these seven lineages, at least one representative is available in culture. The three picoplanktonic genera Ostreococcus, Micromonas, and Bathycoccus (order Mamiellales), were the best represented prasinophytes both in cultures and genetic libraries. SSU rDNA phylogenetic analyses suggest that the genus Bathycoccus forms a very homogeneous group. In contrast, the genera Micromonas and Ostreococcus turned out to be quite complex, consisting of three and four independent lineages, respectively. This report of the overall diversity of picoeukaryotic prasinophytes reveals a group of ecologically important and diverse marine microorganims that are well represented by isolated cultures.},

Information of the biogeography of the Atama complex is limited in the Arctic Ocean. In the present study, we established 55 strains of the Atama complex by incubating ellipsoidal cysts collected from the Chukchi Sea. The vegetative cells are characterized by a prominent ventral pore, thereby fitting the description of A. tamarense morphotype. Large subunit (LSU) and/or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequences of these strains were examined. Both sequences showed intragenomic polymorphism. The 708~bp of the LSU sequences from the strains differed from each other at 0\textendash 44 sites (0.0\textendash 6.2~\%), and the ITS region sequences differed from one another at 0\textendash 28 sites (0.0\textendash 5.4~\%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Chukchi Sea strains were nested within Atama complex (Group I). Assessment of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxin production by four Chukchi Sea strains using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that total toxin per cell ranged from 9 to 41 fmol cell-1. The toxin profile of the four strains from the Chukchi Sea is conserved, with the major toxins being N-sulfocarbamoyl toxin (C2), saxitoxin, and gonyautoxin-4. Our results support that dispersal of the Atama complex (Group I) from the Bering Sea to the Chukchi Sea might have occurred.},

  abstract = {Hydroxyl radicals (OH.) can be formed in aqueous solution by a superoxide (O2.-)-generating system in the presence of a ferric salt or in a reaction independent of O2.- by the direct addition of a ferrous salt. OH. damage was detected in the present work by the release of thiobarbituric acid-reactive material from deoxy sugars, nucleosides and benzoate. The carbohydrates deoxyribose, deoxygalactose and deoxyglucose were substantially degraded by the iron(II) salt and the iron(III) salt in the presence of an O2.- -generating system, whereas deoxyinosine, deoxyadenosine and benzoate were not. Addition of EDTA to the reaction systems producing radicals greatly enhanced damage to deoxyribose, deoxyinosine, deoxyadenosine and benzoate, but decreased damage to deoxygalactose and deoxyglucose. Further, OH. scavengers were effective inhibitors only when EDTA was present. Inhibition by catalase and desferrioxamine confirmed that H2O2 and iron salts were essential for these reactions. The results suggest that, in the absence of EDTA, iron ions bind to the carbohydrate detector molecules and bring about a site-specific reaction on the molecule. This reaction is poorly inhibited by most OH. scavengers, but is strongly inhibited by scavengers such as mannitol, glucose and thiourea, which can themselves bind iron ions, albeit weakly. In the presence of EDTA, however, iron is removed from these binding sites to produce OH. in 'free' solution. These can be readily intercepted by the addition of OH. scavengers.},

  abstract = {Vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) is a homo-octameric flavoenzyme belonging to the VAO/PCMH family. Each VAO subunit consists of two domains, the FAD-binding and the cap domain. VAO catalyses, among other reactions, the two-step conversion of p-creosol (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) to vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). To elucidate how different ligands enter and exit the secluded active site, Monte Carlo based simulations have been performed. One entry/exit path via the subunit interface and two additional exit paths have been identified for phenolic ligands, all leading to the si side of FAD. We argue that the entry/exit path is the most probable route for these ligands. A fourth path leading to the re side of FAD has been found for the co-ligands dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Based on binding energies and on the behaviour of ligands in these four paths, we propose a sequence of events for ligand and co-ligand migration during catalysis. We have also identified two residues, His466 and Tyr503, which could act as concierges of the active site for phenolic ligands, as well as two other residues, Tyr51 and Tyr408, which could act as a gateway to the re side of FAD for dioxygen. Most of the residues in the four paths are also present in VAO's closest relatives, eugenol oxidase and p-cresol methylhydroxylase. Key path residues show movements in our simulations that correspond well to conformations observed in crystal structures of these enzymes. Preservation of other path residues can be linked to the electron acceptor specificity and oligomerisation state of the three enzymes. This study is the first comprehensive overview of ligand and co-ligand migration in a member of the VAO/PCMH family, and provides a proof of concept for the use of an unbiased method to sample this process.},

  abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) has been linked to many regulatory functions in mammalian cells. Studies of NO release are hampered by the short half-life of the molecule. In the blood, NO disappears within seconds because it binds avidly with haemoglobin (Hb). The relationship between Hb concentration and NO disappearance, however, has not been described. In this study we utilized an amperometric NO sensor (WPI, Sarasota, FL) to monitor continuously the disappearance of NO from an aqueous solution when Hb (free or as red blood cells) was added. The calibration and linearity of the NO sensor was checked frequently using a chemical reaction to generate a known concentration of NO. An aliquot of NO solution (prepared from authentic gas) was added to a glass beaker containing 20 ml saline to generate NO concentration of approximately 1200 nM. Under our experimental conditions (PO2 = 40 mmHg), NO concentration fell slowly over 20 min with a half-life of 445 s. However, when haemoglobin was added, NO disappeared rapidly in proportion to Hb concentration. The results suggest that rapid binding of NO to Hb occurs in a 4:1 ratio. The maximum rate constant of NO disappearance due to binding with Hb was 2 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. The 4:1 binding ratio between NO:Hb may be used as a tool to quantitate NO release in some biological assays. The study supports the notion that NO acts as an autocoid because it disappears rapidly in the presence of Hb and is not likely to act as a circulating humoral substance. The NO sensor was useful for monitoring of NO concentration in Hb free solutions, but its response time limits its use in blood.},

We review here the current knowledge and show that Prxs can be effectively classified by a structural/evolutionary organization into six subfamilies followed by specification of a 1-Cys or 2-Cys mechanism, and for 2-Cys Prxs, the structural location of the resolving Cys. We visualize the varied catalytic structural transitions and highlight how they differ depending on the location of the resolving Cys. We also review new insights into the question of how Prxs are such effective catalysts: the enzyme activates not only the conserved Cys thiolate but also the peroxide substrate. Moreover, the hydrogen-bonding network created by the four residues conserved in all Prx active sites stabilizes the transition state of the peroxidatic SN2 displacement reaction. Strict conservation of the peroxidatic active site along with the variation in structural transitions provides a fascinating picture of how the diverse Prxs function to break down peroxide substrates rapidly.

Although reactive compounds containing oxygen are usually harmful to cells when accumulated to relatively high concentrations, they are also instrumental in the control of the activity of a myriad of proteins, and control both the upregulation and downregulation of gene expression. The formation of one oxygen-based molecule, such as the superoxide anion, can lead to a cascade of downstream generation of others, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the hydroxyl radical ({$\bullet$}OH), each with their own reactivity and effect. Nitrogen-based signaling molecules also contain oxygen, and include nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite, both instrumental among the suite of cell signaling components. These molecules do not act alone, but form part of a complex interplay of reactions, including with several sulfur-based compounds, such as glutathione and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Overaccumulation of oxygen-based reactive compounds may alter the redox status of the cell and lead to programmed cell death, in processes referred to as oxidative stress, or nitrosative stress (for nitrogen-based molecules). Here, an overview of the main oxygen-based molecules involved, and the ramifications of their production, is given.},

While vertebrate sulfite oxidase is a mitochondrial enzyme with cytochrome c as the physiological electron acceptor, plant sulfite oxidase is localized in peroxisomes and does not react with cytochrome c. Here we describe results that identified oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor for plant sulfite oxidase and hydrogen peroxide as the product of this reaction in addition to sulfate. The latter finding might explain the peroxisomal localization of plant sulfite oxidase. 18O labeling experiments and the use of catalase provided evidence that plant sulfite oxidase combines its catalytic reaction with a subsequent non-enzymatic step where its reaction product hydrogen peroxide oxidizes another molecule of sulfite. In vitro, for each catalytic cycle plant SO will bring about the oxidation of two molecules of sulfite by one molecule of oxygen. In the plant, sulfite oxidase could be responsible for removing sulfite as a toxic metabolite, which might represent a means to protect the cell against excess of sulfite derived from SO2 gas in the atmosphere (acid rain) or during the decomposition of sulfur-containing amino acids. Finally we present a model for the metabolic interaction between sulfite and catalase in the peroxisome.},

The vital contribution of microorganisms to marine ROS levels, particularly superoxide, has only recently come to light, and thus the specific biological sources and pathways involved in ROS production are largely unknown. To better understand the biogenic controls on ROS levels in tropical oligotrophic systems, we determined rates of superoxide production under various conditions by natural populations of the nitrogen-fixing diazotroph Trichodesmium obtained from various surface waters in the Sargasso Sea. Trichodesmium colonies collected from eight different stations all produced extracellular superoxide at high rates in both the dark and light. Colony density and light had a variable impact on extracellular superoxide production depending on the morphology of the Trichodesmium colonies. Raft morphotypes showed a rapid increase in superoxide production in response to even low levels of light, which was not observed for puff colonies. In contrast, superoxide production rates per colony decreased with increasing colony density for puff morphotypes but not for rafts. These findings point to Trichodesmium as a likely key source of ROS to the surface oligotrophic ocean. The physiological and/or ecological factors underpinning morphology-dependent controls on superoxide production need to be unveiled to better understand and predict superoxide production by Trichodesmium and ROS dynamics within marine systems.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced ubiquitously across the tree of life. Far from being synonymous with toxicity and harm, biological ROS production is increasingly recognized for its essential functions in signaling, growth, biological interactions, and physiochemical defense systems in a diversity of organisms, spanning microbes to mammals. Part of this shift in thinking can be attributed to the wide phylogenetic distribution of specialized mechanisms for ROS production, such as NADPH oxidases, which decouple intracellular and extracellular ROS pools by directly catalyzing the reduction of oxygen in the surrounding aqueous environment. Furthermore, biological ROS production contributes substantially to natural fluxes of ROS in the ocean, thereby influencing the fate of carbon, metals, oxygen, and climate-relevant gases. Here, we review the taxonomic diversity, mechanisms, and roles of extracellular ROS production in marine bacteria, phytoplankton, seaweeds, and corals, highlighting the ecological and biogeochemical influences of this fundamental and remarkably widespread process.},

The higher pH levels chosen for experiments were 8.55 for C. lineatum and 9.2 for the other 2 species. At pH 8.0, which approximates the pH found in the open sea, the maximum growth in all species was maintained until the total DIC concentration was reduced below \textasciitilde 0.4 and 0.2 mM for C. lineatum and the other 2 species, respectively. Growth compensation points (concentration of inorganic carbon needed for maintenance of cells) were reached at \textasciitilde 0.18 and 0.05 mM DIC for C. lineatum and the other 2 species, respectively. At higher pH levels, maximum growth rates were lower compared to growth at pH 8, even at very high DIC concentrations, indicating a direct pH effect on growth. Moreover, the concentration of bio-available inorganic carbon (CO2 + HCO3\textendash ) required for maintenance as well as the half-saturation constants were increased considerably at high pH compared to pH 8.0. Experiments with pH-drift were carried out at initial concentrations of 2.4 and 1.2 mM DIC to test whether pH or DIC was the main limiting factor at a natural range of DIC. Independent of the initial DIC concentrations, growth rates were similar in both incubations until pH had increased considerably. The results of this study demonstrated that growth of the 3 species was mainly limited by pH, while inorganic carbon limitation played a minor role only at very high pH levels and low initial DIC concentrations.},

The nucleotide sequence of the hexose oxidase cDNA contained an open reading frame of 546 amino acid residues with a predicted relative molecular mass of 61,898. No significant sequence similarity was found between hexose oxidase and other protein sequences available in data bases.

Quantifying both intra- and inter-specific variability in trait distributions is key to utilizing traits to distinguish groups of organisms and assess their ecological function. Because examinations of intra-specific variability are rare, here we measured three-dimensional movement behaviors and distribution patterns of seven genetically distinct strains of the ichthyotoxic raphidophyte, Heterosigma akashiwo. Strains were collected from different ocean basins but geographic distance between isolates was a poor predictor of genetic relatedness among strains. Observed behaviors were significantly different among all strains examined, with swimming speed and turning rate ranging from 33\textendash 115 {$\mu$}m s-1 and 41\textendash 110\textdegree{} s-1, respectively. Movement behaviors were consistent over at least 12 h, and in one case identical when measured several years apart. Movement behaviors were not associated with a specific cell size, carbon content, genetic relatedness, or geographic distance. These strain-specific behaviors resulted in algal populations that had distinct vertical distributions in the experimental tank. This study demonstrates that the traits of genetic identity and motility can provide resolution to distinguish strains of species, where variations in size or biomass are insufficient characteristics.},

  abstract = {Glutathione (GSH; {$\gamma$}-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) is a small intracellular thiol molecule which is considered as a strong non-enzymatic antioxidant. Glutathione regulates multiple metabolic functions; for example, it protects membranes by maintaining the reduced state of both {$\alpha$}-tocopherol and zeaxanthin, it prevents the oxidative denaturation of proteins under stress conditions by protecting their thiol groups, and it serves as a substrate for both glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase. By acting as a precursor of phytochelatins, GSH helps in the chelating of toxic metals/metalloids which are then transported and sequestered in the vacuole. The glyoxalase pathway (consisting of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II enzymes) for detoxification of methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic molecule, also requires GSH in the first reaction step. For these reasons, much attention has recently been directed to elucidation of the role of this molecule in conferring tolerance to abiotic stress. Recently, this molecule has drawn much attention because of its interaction with other signaling molecules and phytohormones. In this review, we have discussed the recent progress in GSH biosynthesis, metabolism and its role in abiotic stress tolerance.},

They are needle-shaped diatoms ranging in size from a few {$\mu$}m to several millimetres. Colony formation is represented in all genera but apparently not in all species. Heteropolarity is present in all genera. The two cell ends are different in outline, and one end has apical protrusion(s) or spine(s). Exceptions are Thalassionema nitzschioides, in the sense that the two ends have the same shape, and Thalassiothrix longissima by having protrusions at both ends. Confluent areolae or a marginal ridge at one valve end, a pore in the valve mantle below the apical protrusions, and basically Y-shaped external areolar occlusions are morphological features setting Thalassionema apart from other genera. Marginal pointed spines and winged apical spines are the main morphologically distinctive features of Thalassiothrix. Trichotoxon is morphologically close to Thalassiothrix antarctica but forms ovoid instead of radiating colonies and has no marginal and only minute apical spines. Lioloma has poroid areolae occluded by cribrum or rota type vela, in contrast to the loculate areolae of the three other genera, and furthermore, it possesses bubble-shaped structures on the valve inside. Girdle bands with slit-like perforations were seen in Lioloma whereas bands in the other genera were unperforated. The labiate processes (one at each valve end) of Thalassionema spp., Thalassiothrix longissima, T. antarctica and Trichotoxon have lips of the same size and shape, whereas the other Thalassiothrix spp. and Lioloma have labiate processes shaped like a parrot-beak. A comparison between morphological features of the families Thalassionemataceae, Fragilariaceae and Rhaphoneidaceae shows that prominent diagnostic features of Thalassionemataceae, like the absence of apical pore fields, one labiate process at each valve end and areolation restricted to the valve border, are represented in Rhaphoneidaceae and to some extent in Fragilariaceae. If we accept these characteristics as diagnostically important, then a closer relationship of Thalassionemataceae to Rhaphoneidaceae than to Fragilariaceae is indicated. The characterisation in the literature of Thalassionema nitzschioides as cosmopolitan in distribution, Thalassiothrix longissima as restricted to the northern and temperate parts of the northern hemisphere and T. antarctica and Trichotoxon reinboldii to the Southern Ocean is supported by the present investigation.

However, whether ROS from organelles can act as second messengers in ABA signaling is largely unknown. Here, we identified an ABA overly sensitive mutant, abo6, in a genetic screen for ABA-mediated inhibition of primary root growth. ABO6 encodes a DEXH box RNA helicase that is involved in regulating the splicing of several genes of complex I in mitochondria. The abo6 mutant accumulated more ROS in mitochondria, as established using a mitochondrial superoxide indicator, circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein. Two dominant-negative mutations in ABA insensitive1 (abi1-1) and abi2-1 greatly reduced ROS production in mitochondria. The ABA sensitivity of abo6 can also be compromised by the atrbohF mutation. ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination and primary root growth in abo6 was released by the addition of reduced GSH and exogenous auxin to the medium. Expression of auxin-responsive markers ProDR5:GUS (for synthetic auxin response element D1-4 with site-directed mutants in the 5'-end from soybean):{$\beta$}-glucuronidase) and Indole-3-acetic acid inducible2:GUS was greatly reduced by the abo6 mutation. Hence, our results provide molecular evidence for the interplay between ABA and auxin through the production of ROS from mitochondria.

The south-to-north transect went from a post-bloom situation with a distinct surface mixed layer where nutrients were reduced, through the peak of the bloom, and to spring-like early bloom conditions where the ice cover had just broken up. Furthest north along the Arctic Ocean boundary different blooms were observed. By moving from the Barents Sea northwards towards the shelf break of the Arctic Ocean, a shift in species from a bloom of Arctic/boreal neritic type diatoms to a bloom influenced by oceanic phytoplankton species characteristic of the northern North Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea was seen. The dominating species, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, have earlier been reported from the southern Barents Sea, but is now obviously moving further north. This is due to the sub-surface circumpolar boundary current carrying water of Atlantic origin west of Svalbard and then eastwards along the Eurasian Shelf break. This water mass brings with it cells of oceanic phytoplankton species, which under favourable conditions (moderate Atlantic Water depth below the surface, little vertical stability, limited time in darkness) will reach the surface layer in an open water area and contribute to the primary production there. If longer periods and larger areas with little or no ice are to be more common under future scenarios of a warmer climate, the prevalence of Atlantic phytoplankton species can be expected to increase along the northern perimeter of the western Eurasian shelves. A situation where sympagic algae and Atlantic species co-exist spatially may be more common, and the pelagic production in summer may increase.},

M., Bhaya, D., and Grossman, A. R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 636-640) (corresponding to ScpC, ScpD, ScpB, and ScpE in Funk, C., and Vermaas, W. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 9397-9404) contain a single transmembrane domain. The fifth polypeptide (HemH) represents a fusion between a ferrochelatase and an Hli-like polypeptide. By using an epitope tag to identify specifically the different Hli polypeptides, the accumulation of each (excluding HemH) was examined under various environmental conditions. The levels of all of the Hli polypeptides were elevated in high light and during nitrogen limitation, whereas HliA, HliB, and HliC also accumulated to high levels following exposure to sulfur deprivation and low temperature. The temporal pattern of accumulation was significantly different among the different Hli polypeptides. HliC rapidly accumulated in high light, and its level remained high for at least 24 h. HliA and HliB also accumulated rapidly, but their levels began to decline 9-12 h following the imposition of high light. HliD was transiently expressed in high light and was not detected 24 h after the initiation of high light exposure. These results demonstrate that there is specificity to the accumulation of the Hli polypeptides under a diverse range of environmental conditions. Furthermore, mutants for the individual and combinations of the hli genes were evaluated for their fitness to grow in high light. Although all of the mutants grew as fast as wild-type cells in low light, strains inactivated for hliA or hliC/hliD were unable to compete with wild-type cells during co-cultivation in high light. A mutant lacking all four hli genes gradually lost its photosynthesis capacity and died in high light. Hence, the Hli polypeptides are critical for survival when Synechocystis PCC6803 is absorbing excess excitation energy and may allow the cells to cope more effectively with the production of reactive oxygen species.},

To date, however, their commercially realized exploitation is restricted to a few strains for the production of fine chemicals, nutraceuticals, food additives, and as feed in aquaculture. Algal taxonomy has remained a mystery for applied phycologists. In this chapter, we aim to unriddle this puzzle by providing a brief overview of the difficulties of placing microalgae in a hierarchical, phylogenetically meaningful, classification scheme. The evolutionary origin of algal diversity is discussed, which explains why creating a phylogenetically meaningful classification scheme is fraught with difficulties. Finally, commercially used microalgae or those with demonstrated potential are described with a focus on their identifying characteristics. These described microalgae are then cross-linked to their remediation and bioproduct potential in the last two sections of this chapter.},

During cytokinesis the parental basal body segregates with a new basal body/flagellum, briefly producing a progeny cell typical of other known uniflagellates (i.e. containing a basal body/flagellum and accompanying barren basal body). The parental basal body then disintegrates or ``transforms'' out of existence, leaving both progeny cells with a single basal body/flagellum (i.e. neither progeny cell possesses any vestige of a mature flagellum/basal body). Pelagomonas calceolata belongs to a lineage of chromophyte algae characterized by having a reduced flagellar apparatus, but it is the only known species, not only in this lineage but among all eukaryotes, to have undergone the complete elimination of the mature flagellum /basal body.},

Ascorbic acid and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) scavenged ROS effectively, while {$\alpha$}-tocopherol acetate or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) did not. The presence of rose bengal and hypocrellin A increased the ROS level by photodynamic action in the visible light. The presence of the herbicide, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU), increased ROS production slightly, and ROS formation was greatly enhanced by the addition of methyl viologen due to the fact that this redox system diverts electrons from PSI to oxygen and thus forms ROS. UV-B induces ROS generation by photodynamic action and inhibition of the electron transport by damaging the electron receptors or enzymes associated with the electron transport chain during photosynthesis.},

Superoxide is the short-lived primary photochemical product of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photolysis and also reacts with CDOM or trace metals (Cu, Fe) to form H2O2. In the present work we focused our investigations on reactions between CDOM and superoxide. O2- decay kinetics experiments were performed by adding KO2 to diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) amended seawater and utilizing an established chemiluminescence technique for the detection of O2- at nM levels. In Cape Verdean waters we found a significant reactivity of superoxide with CDOM with maximal rates adjacent to the chlorophyll maximum, presumably from production of new CDOM from bacteria/phytoplankton. This work highlights a poorly understood process which impacts on the biogeochemical cycling of CDOM and trace metals in the open ocean.},

We modified an existing chemiluminescence flow injection system using methyl Cypridina luciferin analog (MCLA) for the detection of O2- and added O2- using KO2 as the source. Our results indicate that O2- in ambient seawater had a half-life ranging from 9.3 to 194 s. DTPA additions to seawater, to remove the effects of reactions with metals, revealed O2- decay rates consistent with a second order reaction, indicating that the dismutation reaction dominated and that reactions with DOM were not significant. Titrations of seawater by the addition of nanomolar amounts of iron or copper revealed the importance of organic chelation of Fe and/or Cu in controlling the reactivity with O2-. Throughout the water column reactions with Cu appeared to be the major sink for superoxide in the Southern Ocean. This new strategy suggests an alternative approach for speciation measurements of Fe and Cu in seawater.},

However, assessment of the productivity with the aid of this method must rely on accurate measurements of the 17O/16O versus 18O/16O relationship in each of the main oxygen-producing and -consuming reactions. Data obtained here showed that cleavage of water in photosystem II did not fractionate oxygen isotopes; the {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}17O of the O2 evolved were essentially identical to those of the substrate water. The fractionation slopes for the oxygenase reaction of Rubisco and respiration were identical (0.518 {$\pm$} 0.001) and that of glycolate oxidation was 0.503 {$\pm$} 0.002. There was a considerable difference in the slopes of O2 photoreduction (the Mehler reaction) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (0.497 {$\pm$} 0.004) and that of pea (Pisum sativum) thylakoids (0.526 {$\pm$} 0.001). These values provided clear and independent evidence that the mechanism of O2 photoreduction differs between higher plants and cyanobacteria. We used our method to assess the magnitude of O2 photoreduction in cyanobacterial cells maintained under conditions where photorespiration was negligible. It was found that electron flow to O2 can be as high as 40\% that leaving photosystem II, whereas respiratory activity in the light is only 6\%. The implications of our findings to the evaluation of specific O2-producing or -consuming reactions, in vivo, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a globally important marine cyanobacterium that lacks the gene catalase and relies on `helper' bacteria such as Alteromonas to remove reactive oxygen species. Increasing atmospheric CO2 decreases the need for carbon concentrating mechanisms and photorespiration in phytoplankton, potentially altering their metabolism and microbial interactions even when carbon is not limiting growth. Here, Prochlorococcus (VOL4, MIT9312) was co-cultured with Alteromonas (strain EZ55) under ambient (400\,p.p.m.) and elevated CO2 (800\,p.p.m.). Under elevated CO2, Prochlorococcus had a significantly longer lag phase and greater apparent die-offs after transfers suggesting an increase in oxidative stress. Whole-transcriptome analysis of Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the carbon fixation operon, including carboxysome subunits, corresponding with significantly fewer carboxysome structures observed by electron microscopy. Prochlorococcus co-culture responsive gene 1 had significantly increased expression in elevated CO2, potentially indicating a shift in the microbial interaction. Transcriptome analysis of Alteromonas in co-culture with Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the catalase gene, known to be critical in relieving oxidative stress in Prochlorococcus by removing hydrogen peroxide. The decrease in catalase gene expression was corroborated by a significant \textasciitilde 6-fold decrease in removal rates of hydrogen peroxide from co-cultures. These data suggest Prochlorococcus may be more vulnerable to oxidative stress under elevated CO2 in part from a decrease in ecosystem services provided by heterotrophs like Alteromonas.

  abstract = {A natural marine phytoplankton assemblage from a coastal environment of Antarctica was experimentally exposed to low salinity sea water (30 vs 34 in the control) during 8days in order to study their physiological and community responses to hypoosmotic stress conditions. Hypoosmotic conditions favour water influx into the cells, which results in increased turgor pressure and increased oxidative stress. This stress is linked to a number of other cellular toxic processes, including damages to proteins, enzyme inactivation and DNA breakage. Inhibition of the instantaneous growth rate started after 48h exposure to low salinity, but at the end of experiment, growth was significantly higher in the low than in the normal (control) salinity treatment. Hypoosmotic conditions prevented phytoplankton biomass accumulation, as evidenced by reduced Chlorophyll-a concentrations as compared to the control treatment. However, in terms of cell numbers and species composition, we observed a gradual replacement of big centric by small pennate diatoms, which became dominant by the end of the experiment. In addition, the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), which are indicative of oxidative stress, were studied. In the low salinity treatments, ROS concentrations were significantly higher than control values on days 4 and 6, decreasing thereafter to nearly initial values. TBARS content increased during the first 48h and then decreased until around day 0 values. This coincided with significant increased values of the antioxidants {$\alpha$}-tocopherol and {$\beta$}-carotene in low salinity treatments over the control. These results suggest the existence of protection mechanisms against lipid peroxidation, and lead to the conclusion that the response to stress is species-specific, so that at the community level a change in the relative abundance of phytoplankton taxa appears as a response to hypoosmotic conditions. This could have important consequences for the trophic food web dynamics in areas influenced by high fresh water inputs.},

We report here the isolation of a gene encoding a homologue of the respiratory burst oxidase gp91phox in C. crispus, named Ccrboh. This single copy gene encodes a polypeptide of 825 amino acids. Search performed in available genome and EST algal databases identified sequences showing common features of NADPH oxidases in other algae such as the red unicellular Cyanidioschyzon merolae, the economically valuable red macro-alga Porphyra yezoensis and the two diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana. Domain organization and phylogenetic relationships with plant, animal, fungal and algal NADPH oxidase homologues were analyzed. Transcription analysis of the C. crispus gene revealed that it was over-transcribed during infection of C. crispus gametophyte by the endophyte A. operculata, and after incubation in presence of atrazine, methyl jasmonate and hydroxyperoxides derived from C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).

Seven species of solitary centric diatoms belonging to four genera were found in the estuary including: Conticribra weissflogii, Cyclotella atomus var. atomus, Cyclotella cryptica, Cyclotella marina, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Discostella pseudostelligera and Thalassiosira pseudonana. Dominant species during blooms were C. meneghiniana and Co. weissflogii in the upper estuary and D. pseudostelligera and T. pseudonana in the middle estuary. The morphological traits used to differentiate between species pairs of similar morphology (C. meneghiniana/C. cryptica or D. pseudostelligera/D. woltereckii) were observed to vary with environmental conditions, denoting a great deal of phenotypic plasticity which would hinder accurate identification of the species when using morphological approaches alone.},

In comparison with automated methods, the use of microscopical measurements allows high taxonomic resolution, up to the species level, and has fewer sources of error.

Although chlorarachniophytes are a small group (the phylum of Chlorarachniophyta contains 14 species in 8 genera), they have variable and complex life cycles that include amoeboid, coccoid, and/or flagellate cells. The majority of chlorarachniophytes possess two or more cell types in their life cycles, and which cell types are found is one of the principle morphological criteria used for species descriptions. Here we describe an unidentified chlorarachniophyte that was isolated from an artificial coral reef that calls this criterion into question. The life cycle of the new strain includes all three major cell types, but DNA barcoding based on the established nucleomorph ITS sequences showed it to share 100\% sequence identity with Lotharella globosa. The type strain of L. globosa was also isolated from a coral reef, but is defined as completely lacking an amoeboid stage throughout its life cycle. We conclude that L. globosa possesses morphological diversity between culture strains, and that the new strain is a variety of L. globosa, which we describe as Lotharella globosa var. fortis var. nov. to include the amoeboid stage in the formal description of L. globosa. This intraspecies variation suggest that gross morphological stages maybe lost rather rapidly, and specifically that the type strain of L. globosa has lost the ability to form the amoeboid stage, perhaps recently. This in turn suggests that even major morphological characters used for taxonomy of this group may be variable in natural populations, and therefore misleading.},

Here we used high-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectromicroscopy to continuously follow cellular chemistry within living obligate anaerobes by monitoring hydrogen bond structures in their cellular water. We observed a sequence of well orchestrated molecular events that correspond to changes in cellular processes in those cells that survive, but only accumulation of radicals in those that do not. We thereby can interpret the adaptive response in terms of transient intracellular chemistry and link it to oxygen stress and survival. This ability to monitor chemical changes at the molecular level can yield important insights into a wide range of adaptive responses.},

  abstract = {Although molecular phylogenetic studies of cyanobacteria on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence have been reported, the topologies were unstable, especially in the inner branchings. Our analysis of 16S rRNA gene phylogeny by the maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining methods combined with rate homogeneous and heterogeneous models revealed seven major evolutionary lineages of the cyanobacteria, including prochlorophycean organisms. These seven lineages are always stable on any combination of these methods and models, fundamentally corresponding to phylogenetic relationships based on other genes, e.g., psbA, rbcL, rnpB, rpoC, and tufA. Moreover, although known genotypic and phenotypic characters sometimes appear paralleled in independent lineages, many characters are not contradictory within each group. Therefore we propose seven evolutionary groups as a working hypothesis for successive taxonomic reconstruction. New 16S rRNA sequences of five unicellular cyanobacterial strains, PCC 7001, PCC 7003, PCC 73109, PCC 7117, and PCC 7335 of Synechococcus sp., were determined in this study. Although all these strains have been assigned to ``marine clusters B and C,'' they were separated into three lineages. This suggests that the organisms classified in the genus Synechococcus evolved diversely and should be reclassified in several independent taxonomic units. Moreover, Synechococcus strains and filamentous cyanobacteria make a monophyletic group supported by a comparatively high statistical confidence value (80 to 100\%) in each of the two independent lineages; therefore, these monophylies probably reflect the convergent evolution of a multicellular organization.},

They maintain their population despite predators, infections, and unfavourable environmental conditions. One of the smallest diatoms, Chaetoceros tenuissimus, can coexist with infectious viruses during blooms. To further understand this relationship, we sequenced the C. tenuissimus strain NIES-3715 genome. A gene fragment of a replication-associated gene from the infectious ssDNA virus (designated endogenous virus-like fragment, EVLF) was found to be integrated into each 41~Mb of haploid assembly. In addition, the EVLF was transcriptionally active and conserved in nine other C. tenuissimus strains from different geographical areas, although the primary structures of their proteins varied. The phylogenetic tree further suggested that the EVLF was acquired by the ancestor of C. tenuissimus. Additionally, retrotransposon genes possessing a reverse transcriptase function were more abundant in C. tenuissimus than in Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Moreover, a target site duplication, a hallmark for long interspersed nuclear element retrotransposons, flanked the EVLF. Therefore, the EVLF was likely integrated by a retrotransposon during viral infection. The present study provides further insights into the diatom-virus evolutionary relationship.},

The dinoflagellate produced large-scale red tides in the bays of central and western Japan and caused mass mortality of bivalves, notably the pearl oysters. The cell is small and is composed of a conical epitheca and a hemi-spheroidal hypothecs. The chloroplast is single and is connected to the single pyrenoid. The nucleus is elongated and is located in the left side of the cell. Thecal plate arrangement has been determined as: Po, cp, 5{${'}$}, 3a, 7{${''}$}, 6c, 5s, 5{${''}{'}$}, 2{${''}{''}$}. Heterocapsa circularisquama is morphologically very similar to Heterocapsa illdefina and it is almost impossible to distinguish these two species at light microscopical level. The characteristics which can be used to distinguish these two species are the morphology of body scales and the ultrastructure of the pyrenoid matrix. The body scales of H. circularisquama possess six radiating ridges on the circular basal plate; no such ridges can be observed on the roughly triangular basal plate of the scales of H. illdefina. Furthermore, the scales of the latter species possess substantially shorter spines compared to those of H. circularisquama. The pyrenoid matrix of H. circularisquama is hardly perforated by cytoplasmic tubules, while in H. tlldefina the pyrenoid matrix is always penetrated by many cytoplasmic tubules. Based on the arrangement of thecal plates, morphology of body scales, and ultra-structure of the pyrenoid, I am placing H. circularisquama sp nov. into the genus Heterocapsa.},

  abstract = {Background Until recent studies documented their extensive contribution to primary productivity and carbon sequestration, haptophytes remained underappreciated players in global ecosystem processes. Contemporary analyses, augmented by the use of molecular probes, show the haptophyte taxon Chrysochromulina to be seminal to the ecology of both marine and freshwater ecosystems. Unfortunately, description for the type species for this clade remains enigmatic. Results Chrysochromulina parva Lackey was re-isolated from Big Walnut Creek (Ohio), the site where the original isolate was obtained. The sequenced haploid genome of this organism is 65.7\,Mb in size. Several noteworthy nuclear-encoded genes identified include a novel ftsZ (mediates organelle division) that phylogenetically clusters with the Chloroarachniophytes. Also revealed, is a complement of genes associated with meiosis and DNA repair, indicating the presence of a sexual cycle in this alga. Mitochondrial genes lost to the nucleus include all extrinsic components of the nad complex, completing a punctate pattern of transfer that is observed among algal taxa. Comparison of the newly sequenced Chrysochromulina parva Lacky isolate was made with that of Chrysochromulina tobinii (59.1\,Mb) \textendash{} a fresh water strain isolated from a lake in Colorado. Conclusion Genomic analysis suggests that fresh water Chrysochromulina isolates, though geographically well separated, from a related clade. The name of the type species of Chrysochromulina parva Lacky is anchored with a lectotype and epitype, and the second isolate is described as Chrysochromulina tobinii sp. nov. Chrysochromulina represents a new, extremely tractable model organism for experimental studies. This oleaginous alga has a small genome and because it represents only the second haptophyte taxon to be sequenced and assembled, presents new opportunity to examine the evolution of an algal taxon that plays an intrinsic role in ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Haptophytes are recognized as seminal players in aquatic ecosystem function. These algae are important in global carbon sequestration, form destructive harmful blooms, and given their rich fatty acid content, serve as a highly nutritive food source to a broad range of eco-cohorts. Haptophyte dominance in both fresh and marine waters is supported by the mixotrophic nature of many taxa. Despite their importance the nuclear genome sequence of only one haptophyte, Emiliania huxleyi (Isochrysidales), is available. Here we report the draft genome sequence of Chrysochromulina tobin (Prymnesiales), and transcriptome data collected at seven time points over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. The nuclear genome of C. tobin is small (59 Mb), compact ({$\sim$}40\% of the genome is protein coding) and encodes approximately 16,777 genes. Genes important to fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression when monitored over the circadian photoperiod. The C. tobin genome harbors the first hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex reported for an algal species, and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. A new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin was also identified, together with two ``red'' RuBisCO activases that are shared across many algal lineages. The Chrysochromulina tobin genome sequence provides new information on the evolutionary history, ecology and economic importance of haptophytes.},

  abstract = {When silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used commercially at a large scale, they infiltrate the environment at a rapid pace. However, the impact of large quantities of AgNPs on aquatic ecosystems is still largely unknown. In aquatic ecosystems, the phytoplanktons have a vital ecological function and, therefore, the potential impact of AgNPs on the microalgae community has elicited substantial concern. Therefore, in this study, the impacts of AgNPs on a marine diatom, the Skeletonema costatum, are investigated, with a focus on their photosynthesis and associated mechanisms. Exposure to AgNPs at a concentration of 0.5mg l 1 significantly induces excess intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS, 122\%) and reduces 28\% of their cell viability. More importantly, exposure to AgNPs reduces the algal chlorophyll-a content. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted, which revealed that AgNPs obstruct the light absorption of algae because they adhere to their surface. The maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) demonstrates that exposure to AgNPs significantly inhibits the conversion of light energy into photosynthetic electron transport. Moreover, the genes of the photosystem II reaction center protein (D1) are significantly down-regulated (P{$<$}0.05) upon exposure to 5mgl 1 AgNPs. These results suggest that the physical adhesion and effects of shading of AgNPs on algaemight affect their light energy delivery systemand damage the crucial protein function of PSII. The photosynthesis inhibition effect of AgNPs is largely different from Ag+. This study shows that AgNPs at higher concentrationsmight have serious consequences for the succession of the phytoplankton communities and aquatic ecosystemequilibrium.

In this study, we compared the community composition of picocyanobacteria from diverse marine ecosystems ranging from estuary to open oceans, tropical to polar oceans and surface to deep water, based on the sequences of 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). A total of 1339 ITS sequences recovered from 20 samples unveiled diverse and several previously unknown clades of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Six high-light (HL)-adapted Prochlorococcus clades were identified, among which clade HLVI had not been described previously. Prochlorococcus clades HLIII, HLIV and HLV, detected in the Equatorial Pacific samples, could be related to the HNLC clades recently found in the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC), iron-depleted tropical oceans. At least four novel Synechococcus clades (out of six clades in total) in subcluster 5.3 were found in subtropical open oceans and the South China Sea. A niche partitioning with depth was observed in the Synechococcus subcluster 5.3. Members of Synechococcus subcluster 5.2 were dominant in the high-latitude waters (northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea), suggesting a possible cold-adaptation of some marine Synechococcus in this subcluster. A distinct shift of the picocyanobacterial community was observed from the Bering Sea to the Chukchi Sea, which reflected the change of water temperature. Our study demonstrates that oceanic systems contain a large pool of diverse picocyanobacteria, and further suggest that new genotypes or ecotypes of picocyanobacteria will continue to emerge, as microbial consortia are explored with advanced sequencing technology.},

The method uses extracellular additions of peroxide and an improved biochemical measurement of the gradient between extracellular and intracellular peroxide concentrations to calibrate the intracellular sensor. By measuring peroxiredoxin activity, we found that this gradient is 650-fold rather than the 7\textendash 10-fold that is widely cited. The resulting calibration is important for understanding the mass-action kinetics of complex networks of redox reactions, and it enables meaningful characterization and comparison of outputs from endogenous peroxide generating tools and therapeutics across studies.},

However, because predicting orthology is computationally intensive at large scale, and most pipelines are relatively inaccessible (e.g., new assignments only available through database updates), less precise homology-based functional transfer is still the default for (meta-)genome annotation. We, therefore, developed eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional annotation of large sets of sequences based on fast orthology assignments using precomputed clusters and phylogenies from the eggNOG database. To validate our method, we benchmarked Gene Ontology (GO) predictions against two widely used homology-based approaches: BLAST and InterProScan. Orthology filters applied to BLAST results reduced the rate of false positive assignments by 11\%, and increased the ratio of experimentally validated terms recovered over all terms assigned per protein by 15\%. Compared with InterProScan, eggNOG-mapper achieved similar proteome coverage and precision while predicting, on average, 41 more terms per protein and increasing the rate of experimentally validated terms recovered over total term assignments per protein by 35\%. EggNOG-mapper predictions scored within the top-5 methods in the three GO categories using the CAFA2 NK-partial benchmark. Finally, we evaluated eggNOG-mapper for functional annotation of metagenomics data, yielding better performance than interProScan. eggNOG-mapper runs {$\sim$}15\texttimes{} faster than BLAST and at least 2.5\texttimes{} faster than InterProScan. The tool is available standalone and as an online service at http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de.},

The bacteria were shown to consume hydrogen peroxide produced by the diatom during photosysnthesis and algal photosynthesis after a hydrogen peroxide shock recovered faster in the presence of bacteria. Three proteobacterial strains isolated from a culture of A. kufferathii were phylogenetically affiliated with the alphaproteobacterial genus Sulfitobacter, the gammaproteobacterial genus Colwellia, and the genus Pibocella of the Bacteriodetes. Native protein gel electrophoresis and enzyme activity staining revealed the presence of superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase in the isolated bacteria and in A. kufferathii cultures. Catalase was detected in bacterial extracts but not in axenic cultures of A. kufferathii. These observations indicate that the epiphytic bacteria make a significant contribution to the diatom's antioxidative defences. The relationship between the bacteria and A. kufferathii seems to be beneficial for both partners and enhances growth of Amphiprora in the sea ice.},

Here we investigate the latitudinal gradients and global predictors of plankton diversity across archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, and major virus clades using both molecular and imaging data from Tara Oceans. We show a decline of diversity for most planktonic groups toward the poles, mainly driven by decreasing ocean temperatures. Projections into the future suggest that severe warming of the surface ocean by the end of the 21st century could lead to tropicalization of the diversity of most planktonic groups in temperate and polar regions. These changes may have multiple consequences for marine ecosystem functioning and services and are expected to be particularly significant in key areas for carbon sequestration, fisheries, and marine conservation.

The role and effectiveness of the first line defense antioxidants which basically include superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is important and indispensable in the entire defense strategy of antioxidants, especially in reference to super oxide anion radical (*O2) which is perpetually generated in normal body metabolism, particularly through the mitochondrial energy production pathway (MEPP). A lot has been published concerning antioxidants and their significance in preventing oxidative stress and the attendant cellular damage, howbeit with paucity of awareness on the fundamental role of SOD, CAT and GPX. The present review tends to articulate important information on SOD, CAT and GPX as first line defense antioxidant enzymes.},

Redox enzymes are notoriously nonspecific, transferring electrons to any good acceptor with which they make electronic contact. This poses a problem for aerobic organisms, since molecular oxygen is small enough to penetrate all but the most shielded active sites of redox enzymes. Adventitious electron transfers to oxygen create superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which are partially reduced species that can oxidize biomolecules with which oxygen itself reacts poorly. This review attempts to present our still-incomplete understanding of how reactive oxygen species are formed inside cells and the mechanisms by which they damage specific target molecules. The vulnerability of cells to oxidation lies at the root of obligate anaerobiosis, spontaneous mutagenesis, and the use of oxidative stress as a biological weapon.},

All known genera and species within Cyanidiophytina were detected in Turkey, including Galdieria phlegrea, recorded up to now only in Italian Phlegrean Fields. By phylogenetic analyses, Turkish G. sulphuraria strains are monophyletic with Italian and Icelandic strains, and with Russian G. daedala strains. G. maxima from Turkey clustered with Icelandic, Kamchatka, and Japanese populations. The discovery of Cyanidiophytina in non-acidic Turkish soils raises new questions about the ecological boundaries of these extremophilic algae.

Similar to terrestrial vegetation1,2,3, marine phytoplankton diversity is a unimodal function of phytoplankton biomass, with maximum diversity at intermediate levels of phytoplankton biomass and minimum diversity during massive blooms.

Most strikingly, these marine biodiversity patterns show a worldwide consistency, despite obvious differences in environmental conditions of the various oceanographic regions. These findings may serve as a new benchmark in the search for global biodiversity patterns of plants and herbivores.},

  abstract = {Acquisition of new photosynthetic pigments has been a crucial process for the evolution of photosynthesis and photosynthetic organisms. In this process, pigment-binding proteins must evolve to fit new pigments. Prochlorococcus is a unique photosynthetic organism that uses divinyl chlorophyll (DVChl) instead of monovinyl chlorophyll. However, cyanobacterial mutants that accumulate DVChl immediately die even under medium-light conditions, suggesting that chlorophyll (Chl)-binding proteins had to evolve to fit to DVChl concurrently with Prochlorococcus evolution. To elucidate the coevolutionary process of Chl and Chl-binding proteins during the establishment of DVChl-based photosystems, we first compared the amino acid sequences of Chl-binding proteins in Prochlorococcus with those in other photosynthetic organisms. Two amino acid residues of the D1 protein, V205 and G282, are conserved in monovinyl chlorophyll-based photosystems; however, in Prochlorococcus, they are substituted with M205 and C282, respectively. According to the solved photosystem II structure, these amino acids are not involved in Chl binding. To mimic Prochlorococcus, V205 was mutated to M205 in the D1 protein from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Synechocystis dvr mutant was transformed with this construct. Although these transgenic cells could not grow under high-light conditions, they acquired light tolerance and grew under medium-light conditions, whereas untransformed dvr mutants could not survive. Substitution of G282 for C282 contributed additional light tolerance, suggesting that the amino acid substitutions in the D1 protein played an essential role in the development of DVChl-based photosystems. Here, we discuss the coevolution of a photosynthetic pigment and its binding protein.},

Reversible S-nitrosation, similarly to other redox-base modifications of protein thiols, has a profound effect on protein structure and activity and is considered as a convergence of signaling pathways of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. In plant, S-nitrosation is involved in a wide array of cellular processes during normal development and stress responses. This review summarizes current knowledge on S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a key enzyme which regulates intracellular levels of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and indirectly also of protein S-nitrosothiols. GSNOR functions are mediated by its enzymatic activity, which catalyzes irreversible GSNO conversion to oxidized glutathione within the cellular catabolism of nitric oxide. GSNOR is involved in the maintenance of balanced levels of reactive nitrogen species and in the control of cellular redox state. Multiple functions of GSNOR in plant development via NO-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms and in plant defense responses to abiotic and biotic stress conditions have been uncovered. Extensive studies of plants with down- and upregulated GSNOR, together with application of transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, seem promising for new insights into plant S-nitrosothiol metabolism and its regulation.},

In this study, we report Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11801, a strain isolated from India that fulfills these requirements. The physiological and biochemical characteristics of PCC 11801 under carbon and light-limiting conditions were investigated.

Grazing by N. scintillans increased the mean colony size by up to 50\% relative to the controls, whereas grazing by G. dominans enhanced the mean colony size by up to 3-fold. Microscopic observations confirmed that N. scintillans was also able to ingest small colonies.

Slow recovery of starved grazers subsequently allowed solitary P. globosa cells to resume exponential growth.

  abstract = {Increasing appreciation of the causative role of oxidative injury in many disease states places great importance on the reliable assessment of lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of several low-molecular-weight end products formed via the decomposition of certain primary and secondary lipid peroxidation products. At low pH and elavated temperature, MDA readily participates in nucleophilic addition reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA), generating a red, fluorescent 1:2 MDA:TBA adduct. These facts, along with the availability of facile and sensitive methods to quantify MDA (as the free aldehyde or its TBA derivative), have led to the routine use of MDA determination and, particularly, the ``TBA test'' to detect and quantify lipid peroxidation in a wide array of sample types. However, MDA itself participates in reactions with molecules other than TBA and is a catabolic substrate. Only certain lipid peroxidation products generate MDA (invariably with low yields), and MDA is neither the sole end product of fatty peroxide formation and decomposition nor a substance generated exclusively through lipid peroxidation. Many factors (e.g., stimulus for and conditions of peroxidation) modulate MDA formation from lipid. Additional factors (e.g., TBA-test reagents and constituents) have profound effects on test response to fatty peroxide-derived MDA. The TBA test is intrinsically nonspecific for MDA: nonlipid-related materials as well as fatty peroxide-derived decomposition products other than MDA are TBA positive. These and other considerations from the extensive literature on MDA, TBA reactivity, and oxidative lipid degradation support the conclusion that MDA determination and the TBA test can offer, at best, a narrow and somewhat empirical window on the complex process of lipid peroxidation. The MDA content and/or TBA reactivity of a system provides no information on the precise structures of the ``MDA precursor(s),'' their molecular origins, or the amount of each formed. Consequently, neither MDA determination nor TBA-test response can generally be regarded as a diagnostic index of the occurrence/extent of lipid peroxidation, fatty hydroperoxide formation, or oxidative injury to tissue lipid without independent chemical evidence of the analyte being measured and its source. In some cases, MDA/TBA reactivity is an indicator of lipid peroxidation; in other situations, no qualitative or quantitative relationship exists among sample MDA content, TBA reactivity, and fatty peroxide tone. Utilization of MDA analysis and/or the TBA test and interpretation of sample MDA content and TBA test response in studies of lipid peroxidation require caution, discretion, and (especially in biological systems) correlative data from other indices of fatty peroxide formation and decomposition.},

  abstract = {Dinoflagellates are key species in marine environments, but they remain poorly understood in part because of their large, complex genomes, unique molecular biology, and unresolved in-group relationships. We created a taxonomically representative dataset of dinoflagellate transcriptomes and used this to infer a strongly supported phylogeny to map major morphological and molecular transitions in dinoflagellate evolution. Our results show an early-branching position of Noctiluca, monophyly of thecate (plate-bearing) dinoflagellates, and paraphyly of athecate ones. This represents unambiguous phylogenetic evidence for a single origin of the group's cellulosic theca, which we show coincided with a radiation of cellulases implicated in cell division. By integrating dinoflagellate molecular, fossil, and biogeochemical evidence, we propose a revised model for the evolution of thecal tabulations and suggest that the late acquisition of dinosterol in the group is inconsistent with dinoflagellates being the source of this biomarker in pre-Mesozoic strata. Three distantly related, fundamentally nonphotosynthetic dinoflagellates, Noctiluca, Oxyrrhis, and Dinophysis, contain cryptic plastidial metabolisms and lack alternative cytosolic pathways, suggesting that all free-living dinoflagellates are metabolically dependent on plastids. This finding led us to propose general mechanisms of dependency on plastid organelles in eukaryotes that have lost photosynthesis; it also suggests that the evolutionary origin of bioluminescence in nonphotosynthetic dinoflagellates may be linked to plastidic tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Finally, we use our phylogenetic framework to show that dinoflagellate nuclei have recruited DNA-binding proteins in three distinct evolutionary waves, which included two independent acquisitions of bacterial histone-like proteins.},

  abstract = {Planktonic mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates are ubiquitous protists and often abundant in marine environments. Recently many phototrophic dinoflagellate species have been revealed to be mixotrophic organisms and also it is suggested that most dinoflagellates may be mixotrophic or heterotrophic protists. The mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates are able to feed on diverse prey items including bacteria, picoeukaryotes, nanoflagellates, diatoms, other dinoflagellates, heterotrophic protists, and metazoans due to their diverse feeding mechanisms. In turn they are ingested by many kinds of predators. Thus, the roles of the dinoflagellates in marine planktonic food webs are very diverse. The present paper reviewed the kind of prey which mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates are able to feed on, feeding mechanisms, growth and ingestion rates of dinoflagellates, grazing impact by dinoflagellate predators on natural prey populations, predators on dinoflagellates, and red tides dominated by dinoflagellates. Based on this information, we suggested a new marine planktonic food web focusing on mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates and provided an insight on the roles of dinoflagellates in the food web.},

The models were based on cell density (N) dependent parameterizations of the spectral backscattering coefficients, bb({$\lambda$}), obtained from in situ measurements. There was a strong relationship between bb({$\lambda$}) and N, with a minimum regression coefficient of 0.97 at 488 nm and a maximum value of 0.98 at other bands. The cell density calculated by the multiband inversion model was similar to the field measurements of the coastal waters (the average relative error was only 8.9\%), but it could not accurately discern the red tide from mixed pixels, and this led to overestimation of the area affected by the red tide. While the single-band inversion model is less precise than the former model in the high chlorophyll water, it could eliminate the impact of the suspended sediments and make more accurate estimates of the red tide area. We concluded that the two models both have advantages and disadvantages; these methods lay the foundation for developing a remote sensing forecasting system for red tides.},

The activity of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes was higher in mitochondria than in peroxisomes, except for APX, which was more active in peroxisomes than in mitochondria. Intact mitochondria and peroxisomes had no latent APX activity, and this remained in the membrane fraction after solubilization assays with 0.2 M KCl. Monodehydroascorbate reductase was highly latent in intact mitochondria and peroxisomes and was membrane-bound, suggesting that the electron acceptor and donor sites of this redox protein are not on the external side of the mitochondrial and peroxisomal membranes. Dehydroascorbate reductase was found mainly in the soluble peroxisomal and mitochondrial fractions. Glutathione reductase had a high latency in mitochondria and peroxisomes and was present in the soluble fractions of both organelles. In intact peroxisomes and mitochondria, the presence of reduced ascorbate and glutathione and the oxidized forms of ascorbate and glutathione were demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The ascorbate-glutathione cycle of mitochondria and peroxisomes could represent an important antioxidant protection system against H2O2 generated in both plant organelles.},

  abstract = {Marine diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton in the temperate oceans and coastal regions, contributing to global photosynthesis, biogeochemical cycling of key nutrients and minerals and aquatic food chains. Integral to the success of marine diatoms is a diverse array of bacterial species that closely interact within the diffusive boundary layer, or phycosphere, surrounding the diatom partner. Recently, we isolated seven distinct bacterial species from cultures of Skeletonema marinoi, a chain-forming, centric diatom that dominates the coastal regions of the temperate oceans. Genomes of all seven bacteria were sequenced revealing many unusual characteristics such as the existence of numerous plasmids of widely varying sizes. Here we have investigated the characteristics of the bacterial interactions with S. marinoi, demonstrating that several strains (Arenibacter algicola strain SMS7, Marinobacter salarius strain SMR5, Sphingorhabdus flavimaris strain SMR4y, Sulfitobacter pseudonitzschiae strain SMR1, Yoonia vestfoldensis strain SMR4r and Roseovarius mucosus strain SMR3) stimulate growth of the diatom partner. Testing of many different environmental factors including low iron concentration, high and low temperatures, and chemical signals showed variable effects on this growth enhancement by each bacterial species, with the most significant being light quality in which green and blue but not red light enhanced the stimulatory effect on S. marinoi growth by all bacteria. Several of the bacteria also inhibited growth of one or more of the other bacterial strains to different extents when mixed together. This study highlights the complex interactions between diatoms and their associated bacteria within the phycosphere, and that further studies are needed to resolve the underlying mechanisms for these relationships and how they might influence the global success of marine diatoms.},

However, when stressed or wounded, diatoms can produce oxylipin molecules known to inhibit the reproduction and development of copepods and decrease microzooplankton growth rates. Using oxylipin chemical treatments, lipidomic analysis and functional genomic approaches, we provide evidence that nitric oxide (NO) and oxylipin signalling pathways in diatoms respond to protist grazers, resulting in increased defence fitness and survival. Exposure of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to the dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina resulted in NO production by P. tricornutum and pronounced change in its dissolved oxylipin profile. Experimentally elevating levels of NO also resulted in increased oxylipin production, and lower overall grazing rates. Furthermore, O. marina preferentially grazed on P. tricornutum prey with lower levels of NO, suggesting that this molecule and its effect on oxylipin pathways play a key role in prey selection. Exposure of O. marina grazing on P. tricornutum to exogenous oxylipins also decreased grazing rates, which is consistent with a grazing deterrence role for these molecules. These results suggest that NO and oxylipin production help to structure diatom communities, in part by modulating interactions with microzooplankton predators.},

In contrast, a single ecotype of the prasinophyte Micromonas is frequently the most abundant photosynthetic taxon reported in the Arctic from summer through autumn. However, seasonal dynamics of prasinophytes outside of this period are little known. To address this, we analyzed high-throughput V4 18S rRNA amplicon data collected from November to July in the Amundsen Gulf Region, Beaufort Sea, Arctic. Surprisingly during polar sunset in November and December, we found a high proportion of reads from both DNA and RNA belonging to another prasinophyte, Bathycoccus. We then analyzed a metagenome from a December sample and the resulting Bathycoccus metagenome assembled genome (MAG) covered \textasciitilde 90\% of the Bathycoccus Ban7 reference genome. In contrast, only \textasciitilde 20\% of a reference Micromonas genome was found in the metagenome. Our phylogenetic analysis of marker genes placed the Arctic Bathycoccus in the B1 coastal clade. In addition, substitution rates of 129 coding DNA sequences were \textasciitilde 1.6\% divergent between the Arctic MAG and coastal Chilean upwelling MAGs and 17.3\% between it and a South East Atlantic open ocean MAG in the B2 Clade. The metagenomic analysis also revealed a winter viral community highly skewed toward viruses targeting Micromonas, with a much lower diversity of viruses targeting Bathycoccus. Overall a combination of Micromonas being relatively less able to maintain activity under dark winter conditions and viral suppression of Micromonas may have contributed to the success of Bathycoccus in the Amundsen Gulf during winter.},

Correlations between Chl and SLA at seasonal and interannual time scales were examined using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method of the cross-covariance matrix between Chl and SLA. Both seasonal cycles are negatively correlated in the whole basin, indicating that the nutrient availability in the surface layer for biological uptake is associated with the changes in the water column stratification. The coupled patterns, by applying the SVD method to Chl and SLA deviations from their seasonal cycles, identify three distinct biological responses to the circulation. The first pattern (explaining 70\% of the covariance between Chl and SLA) indicates Chl enhancements around the Balearic Islands related to the Balearic current reinforced by the Northern current. The second pattern (12\% of the covariance) shows that the peninsular coast is rather isolated from the regional surface circulation and its behavior is determined by the Ebro river discharges and land runoff. The third pattern (9\%) represents higher Chl values along the peninsular slope and lower Chl around the Balearic Islands linked to the Northern current crossing the Ibiza channel without feeding the Baleric current.},

  abstract = {\textbullet{} Premise of the study: Diatoms have long been known as the most species-rich of algal groups, with a wide range of estimates for species number (20\textendash 200 k) due to differing species concepts. The fine valve structure in Asterionellopsis glacialis, a diatom believed cosmopolitan and eurytopic, has never been systematically examined using modern microscopy and is an excellent candidate to genetically test morphology-based conspecificity among its geographically distant culture isolates. \textbullet{} Methods: Isolates from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that were morphologically delineated as A. glacialis were genetically characterized using three nuclear DNA regions (two 18S rDNA fragments and ITS region) and one plastidal (rbcL) and one mitochondrial gene (cox1) and related to SEM-based morphometrics. \textbullet{} Key results: Five genetically distinct groupings were found, four of which are new to science. ITS2 RNA transcript secondary structure was species specific as were plastidal and mitochondrial genes, while the 18S gene fragments did not diverge sufficiently to segregate new species efficiently. We genetically circumscribed the A. glacialis epitype. \textbullet{} Conclusions: The morphological diversification of the species examined in this study lags behind their genetic divergence. The currently accepted 2\% cutoff level of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering in 18S rDNA environmental sequencing is too high to recognize genetic diversity in Asterionellopsis and very likely in many other species. Our results support the notion that a considerable number of species and diversity remain to be discovered among diatoms and that species number may be more in line with higher estimates. Molecular signatures of the species discovered here will aid in their globally consistent identification and ultimate understanding of their ecology.},

  abstract = {Low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide strongly inhibit CO2 fixation of isolated intact chloroplasts (50\% inhibition at 10-5 M hydrogen peroxide). Addition of catalase to a suspension of intact chloroplasts stimulates CO2 fixation 2\textendash 6 fold, indicating that this process is partially inhibited by endogenous hydrogen peroxide formed in a Mehler reaction. The rate of CO2 fixation is strongly increased by addition of Calvin cycle intermediates if the catalase activity of the preparation is low. However, at high catalase activity addition of Calvin cycle intermediates remains without effect. Obviously the hydrogen peroxide formed at low catalase activity leads to a loss of Calvin cycle substrates which reduces the rate of CO2 fixation. 3-Phosphoglycerate-dependent O2-evolution is not influenced by hydrogen peroxide at a concentration (5 {$\cdot$} 10-4 M) which inhibits CO2 fixation almost completely. Therefore the inhibition site of hydrogen peroxide cannot be at the step of 3-phosphoglycerate reduction. Dark CO2 fixation of lysed chloroplasts in a hypotonic medium is not or only slightly inhibited by hydrogen peroxide (2.5 {$\cdot$} 10-4 M), if ribulose-1,5-diphosphate, ribose 5-phosphate or xylulose 5-phosphate were added as substrates. However, there is a strong inhibition of CO2 fixation by hydrogen peroxide, if fructose 6-phosphate together with triose phosphate are used as substrates. This indicates that hydrogen peroxide interrupts the Calvin cycle at the transketolase step, leading to a reduced supply of the CO2-acceptor ribulose 1,5-diphosphate.},

Dramatic change in the current view of risk factors for IDD from one where age and mechanical factors were paramount to the current theory that genetic risk factors are predominant, we thought that it is important to review the studies of the genetic influences on IDD beginning from familial aggregation and heritability estimation and finishing with specific studies of genes associated with IDD. Methods A literature-based narrative review of English language medical literature. Results and conclusions Prior research has demonstrated the existence of familial predisposition to IDD with generally high heritabilities that range from 34\% to 61\% in different spine locations. Segregation analysis shows that the mode of inheritance is complex with multiple factors and multiple genes likely involved in intergenerational transmission.},

  abstract = {Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are metalloproteins that protect organisms from toxic reactive oxygen species by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. Chlorovirus PBCV-1 encodes a 187-amino-acid protein that resembles a Cu-Zn SOD with all of the conserved amino acid residues for binding copper and zinc (named cvSOD). cvSOD has an internal Met that results in a 165-amino-acid protein (named tcvSOD). Both cvSOD and tcvSOD recombinant proteins inhibited nitroblue tetrazolium reduction of superoxide anion generated in a xanthine-xanthine oxidase system in solution. tcvSOD was chosen for further characterization because it was easier to produce. Recombinant tcvSOD also inhibited a riboflavin photochemical reduction system in a polyacrylamide gel assay, which was blocked by the Cu-Zn SOD inhibitor cyanide but not by azide, which inhibits Fe and Mn SODs. A k cat/Km value for cvSOD was determined by stop-flow spectrophotometry as 1.28 \texttimes{} 108 M-1 s-1, suggesting that cvSOD-catalyzed O2 - dismutation was not a diffusion controlled encounter. The cvsod gene was expressed as a late gene, and cvSOD activity was detected in purified virions. Superoxide accumulated rapidly during virus infection, and circumstantial evidence indicates that cvSOD aids its decomposition to benefit virus replication. Cu-Zn SOD homologs have been described to occur in 3 other families of large DNA viruses, poxviruses, baculoviruses, and mimiviruses, which group as a clade. Interestingly, cvSOD does not group in the same clade as the other virus SODs but instead groups in an expanded clade that includes Cu-Zn SODs from many cellular organisms. IMPORTANCE Virus infection often leads to an increase in toxic reactive oxygen species in the host, which can be detrimental to virus replication. Viruses have developed various ways to overcome this barrier. As reported in this article, the chloroviruses often encode and package a functional Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase in the virion that presumably lowers the concentration of reactive oxygen induced early during virus infection.},

It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence patterns, appropriate scoring values can be assigned to the individual residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which are "optimal" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns. Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically significant subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis gene.},

  abstract = {H(2)DCF-DA (dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate) is widely used to evaluate 'cellular oxidative stress'. After passing through the plasma membrane, this lipophilic and non-fluorescent compound is de-esterified to a hydrophilic alcohol [H(2)DCF (dihydrodichlorofluorescein)] that may be oxidized to fluorescent DCF (2',7'-dichlorofluorescein) by a process usually considered to involve ROS (reactive oxygen species). It is, however, not always recognized that, being a hydrophilic molecule, H(2)DCF does not cross membranes, except for the outer fenestrated mitochondrial ones. It is also not generally realized that oxidation of H(2)DCF is dependent either on Fenton-type reactions or on unspecific enzymatic oxidation by cytochrome c, for neither superoxide, nor H(2)O(2), directly oxidizes H(2)DCF. Consequently, oxidation of H(2)DCF requires the presence of either cytochrome c or of both redox-active transition metals and H(2)O(2). Redox-active metals exist mainly within lysosomes, whereas cytochrome c resides bound to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Following exposure to H(2)DCF-DA, weak mitochondrial fluorescence was found in both the oxidation-resistant ARPE-19 cells and the much more sensitive J774 cells. This fluorescence was only marginally enhanced following short exposure to H(2)O(2), showing that by itself it is unable to oxidize H(2)DCF. Cells that were either exposed to the lysosomotropic detergent MSDH (O-methylserine dodecylamide hydrochloride), exposed to prolonged oxidative stress, or spontaneously apoptotic showed lysosomal permeabilization and strong DCF-induced fluorescence. The results suggest that DCF-dependent fluorescence largely reflects relocation to the cytosol of lysosomal iron and/or mitochondrial cytochrome c.},

  abstract = {We present solutions for nutrient transfer to osmotrophs in the full range of flow regimes for which solutions have been published, and we extend some of those solutions to new parameter domains and flow environments. These regimes include stagnant water; steady, unitorm flow arising from swimming or sinking; steady shear flows; and fluctuating shear from dissipation of turbulence, as well as the combined effects of turbulence-induced shear and swimming or sinking. Solutions for nutrient fluxes cannot be carried over from one flow regime to another. In all cases, however, mass transfer increases with cell size and with flow velocity. Cell shape becomes particularly important at high flow velocities. For steady, uniform flow arising from sinking or swimming, we find asymptotic analytic and numerical solutions from the engineering literature superior to those in more common use within oceanography. These engineering solutions suggest flow effects an order of magnitude smaller than commonly supposed. A cell radius near 20 Ilm is needed before swimming or sinking can be expected to increase the flux of nutrients, such as nitrate or phosphate, substantially (by \textasciitilde 50\%) over the stagnant-water case. We find sound asymptotic solutions for the case oflinear shear and supplement them with numerical solutions of our own to cover the range of cell sizes and shear rates of interest for phytoplankton. We extend them further to cover viscous shears from dissipating turbulence for cells smaller than the Kolmogorov scale (order of 1-6mm in the ocean). Our analysis suggests turbulence effects an order of magnitude greater than previously postulated, with a cell size of 60\textasciitilde lm needed to experience substantial gain. Cell rotation, whether induced by the propulsion mechanism in swimming or passively by shear across the cell perimeter, will reduce the rate of nutrient transfer relative to a non-rotating cell unless the axis of rotation parallels the direction of flow. Although in calm water dinoflagellates by swimming are able to increase nutrient uptake, in strong turbulence they may not be able to maintain a rotational axis parallel to the direction of swimming or the direction of shear, resulting in a relative reduction in flux. Conversely, large chains of diatoms and filamentous cyanobacteria that span the radius of the smallest vortices are best able to take advantage of turbulence. Despite these deductions from a diversity of analytic and numerical solutions, unequivocal data to test the contribution of advection to nutrient acquisition by phytoplankton are scarce - owing, in large part, to the inability to visualize, record and thus mimic fluid motions in the vicinities of cells in natural flows.},

  abstract = {Plastids and mitochondria each arose from a single endosymbiotic event and share many similarities in how they were reduced and integrated with their host. However, the subsequent evolution of the two organelles could hardly be more different: mitochondria are a stable fixture of eukaryotic cells that are neither lost nor shuffled between lineages, whereas plastid evolution has been a complex mix of movement, loss and replacement. Molecular data from the past decade have substantially untangled this complex history, and we now know that plastids are derived from a single endosymbiotic event in the ancestor of glaucophytes, red algae and green algae (including plants). The plastids of both red algae and green algae were subsequently transferred to other lineages by secondary endosymbiosis. Green algal plastids were taken up by euglenids and chlorarachniophytes, as well as one small group of dinoflagellates. Red algae appear to have been taken up only once, giving rise to a diverse group called chromalveolates. Additional layers of complexity come from plastid loss, which has happened at least once and probably many times, and replacement. Plastid loss is difficult to prove, and cryptic, non-photosynthetic plastids are being found in many non-photosynthetic lineages. In other cases, photosynthetic lineages are now understood to have evolved from ancestors with a plastid of different origin, so an ancestral plastid has been replaced with a new one. Such replacement has taken place in several dinoflagellates (by tertiary endosymbiosis with other chromalveolates or serial secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga), and apparently also in two rhizarian lineages: chlorarachniophytes and Paulinella (which appear to have evolved from chromalveolate ancestors). The many twists and turns of plastid evolution each represent major evolutionary transitions, and each offers a glimpse into how genomes evolve and how cells integrate through gene transfers and protein trafficking.},

  abstract = {The concept that the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (HO) could be generated from an interaction between superoxide (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was proposed (with Joseph Weiss) in Professor Haber's final paper published in 1934. Until it was recognized that free radicals are produced in biological systems, this finding seemed to have no relevance to biology. However, following the discovery that O2- was a normal cellular metabolite, it was quickly recognized that the Haber\textendash Weiss reaction (O2-+H2O2 \textrightarrow{} HO+O2+HO-) might provide a means to generate more toxic radicals. Although the basic reaction has a second order rate constant of zero in aqueous solution and thus cannot occur in biological systems, the ability of iron salts to serve as catalysts was discussed by these authors. Because transition metal ions, particularly iron, are present at low levels in biological systems, this pathway (commonly referred to as the iron-catalyzed Haber\textendash Weiss reaction) has been widely postulated to account for the in vivo generation of the highly reactive HO. Recent data documenting the importance of redox regulation of various cellular signaling pathways makes it clear that free radicals are essential for normal cellular function. However, this also makes it obvious that disruptions of free radical production or defenses at many different levels can lead to adverse effects on cells. While the generation of HO, which is by far the most reactive oxygen species, is generally indicative of an overtly toxic event, it is through studies at this level that we have reached a better understanding of free radicals as both signaling molecules and toxic species.},

  abstract = {As "the most abundant protein in the world," ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) attracts the attention of genetic engineers and plant phylogeneticists. The active site, which is responsible for almost all carbon fixation on earth, is in the large subunit (LSU). Over 30\% of the 476 amino acids in the LSU are involved in intermolecular associations. Using available sequence data, we find that 105 (22\%) of the residues are absolutely conserved across 499 seed plants, with an additional 110 demonstrating only one change. Our analyses show that conserved domains are not fully explained by current structural data. This has several implications for systematic studies. First, the number of potentially variable sites is likely to be slightly over 1000, rather than 1428. Second, rates of change can vary greatly across the molecule; functional constraints on amino acids and codon biases greatly increase the potential for homoplasy. Third, some changes are correlated, and thus might be down-weighted accordingly. Fourth, some of the variation in RuBisCO may be adaptive and present insights into the nature of evolutionary change in response to the environment.}

Observed aqueous peroxide concentrations ranged from less than 0.1 {$\mu$}M to over 100 {$\mu$}M, with rain samples, precipitating cloudwater samples, and nonprecipitating cloudwater samples all exhibiting median values of less than 10 {$\mu$}M and similar concentration distributions. Specific analyses for H2O2 on 48 of the samples showed that in the majority of samples tested, H2O2 was the sole contributor to the total peroxide concentration, but in some samples, substantial signal was observed after selective destruction of H2O2, possibly indicating the presence of organic peroxides. Calculation of the total potential partial pressure of H2O2 for the samples collected in nonprecipitating clouds, using the measured aqueous concentrations and cloud liquid water content values, indicates a median potential partial pressure of H2O2 of 0.1 ppbv, and a maximum value of approximately 1 ppbv, Gaseous SO2 and aqueous peroxide were rarely simultaneously present in substantial concentrations; generally one reactant was present in great excess over the other, consistent with the occurrence of the aqueous phase reaction of peroxide with S(IV) in which one or the other species is the limiting reagent. Evaluation of the rates of S(IV) oxidation by peroxide and ozone, under conditions representative of the clouds sampled in this study, indicates that the former reaction, but not the latter, can produce substantial acidification in such clouds.},

However, the role of NO in marine photosynthetic microbes remains unclear and even less is known about the role of this metabolite in Antarctic sea-ice diatoms. Using a combination of microsensors, microfluidic chambers, and artificial sea-ice tanks, a basic mechanistic insight into NO's dynamics within the Antarctic sea-ice diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus was obtained. Results suggest that NO production in F. cylindrus is nitrite-dependent via nitrate reductase. NO production was abolished upon exposure to light but could be induced in the light when normal photosynthetic electron flow was disrupted. The addition of exogenous NO to cellular suspensions of F. cylindrus negatively influenced growth, disrupted photosynthesis, and altered non-photochemical dissipation mechanisms. NO production was also observed when cells were exposed to stressful salinity and temperature regimes. These results suggest that during periods of environmental stress, NO could be produced in F. cylindrus as a ``stress signa'' molecule.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are perhaps the most diverse lineage of eukaryotic algae, with their siliceous cell wall and diplontic life history often considered to have played important roles in their extraordinary diversification. The characteristic diminution of the diatom cell wall over the course of vegetative growth provides a reliable, intrinsic trigger for sexual reproduction, establishing a direct link between the evolution of their cell-wall and life-history features. It is unclear, however, whether the diplontic life cycle of diatoms represents an ancestral or derived trait. This uncertainty is based in part on our lack of understanding of the life cycle of the sister lineage to diatoms, which includes a mix of two free-living and separately classified forms: naked biflagellate unicells in the genus Bolidomonas and silicified forms in the order Parmales. These two forms might represent different life-history stages, although directly establishing such links can be difficult. We sequenced transcriptomes for Bolidomonas and two diatoms and found that 0.1\% of the coding regions in the two diploid diatoms are heterozygous, whereas Bolidomonas is virtually devoid of heterozygous alleles, consistent with expectations for a haploid genome. These results suggest that Bolidomonas is haploid and predict that parmaleans represent the diploid phase of a haplodiplontic life cycle. These data fill an important gap in our understanding of the origin of the diplontic life history of diatoms, which may represent an evolutionarily derived, adaptive feature.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a marine cyanobacterium that numerically dominates the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph. Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct. All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light (LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates) and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution. There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes. They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction, to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene. Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes, helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles, especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core. Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the "leaves of the tree," between the most closely related strains. Finally, the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and the wild.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Phagocytes produce both nitric oxide and superoxide as components of the oxidative defense against pathogens. Neither molecule is likely at physiological concentrations to kill cells. However, two of their reaction products, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite, are strong oxidants, cell-permeant, and toxic. Hydrogen peroxide generates oxidative DNA damage, while the primary mechanism of toxicity of peroxynitrite has not yet been determined. Recent \emph{in vitro} studies indicated that peroxynitrite is capable of oxidizing the [4Fe-4S] clusters of a family of dehydratases (Hausladen, A., and Fridovich, I. (1994) \emph{J. Biol. Chem.} 269, 29405\textendash 29408; Castro, L., Rodriguez, M., and Radi, R. (1994) \emph{J. Biol. Chem.} 269, 29409\textendash 29415). We demonstrate here that peroxynitrite at 1\% of its lethal dose almost fully inactivated the labile dehydratases in \emph{Escherichia coli}. The rate at which peroxynitrite inactivated the clusters substantially exceeded the rate at which it oxidized thiols or spontaneously decomposed. These results suggest that these dehydratases may be primary targets of peroxynitrite \emph{in vivo}. Another consequence of the cluster damage was the release of 100 {$\mu$}m iron into the cytosol. During phagocytosis, this intracellular free iron could increase lethal DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide or protein modification by additional peroxynitrite. In response to peroxynitrite challenges, \emph{E. coli} rapidly sequestered the intracellular free iron using an undefined scavenging system. The iron-sulfur clusters were more gradually repaired by a process that drew iron from its iron-storage proteins. These are likely to be critical events in the struggle between phagocyte and pathogen.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Ccps are located in the periplasms of bacteria and the mitochondrial intermembrane spaces of fungi. In this study, Ccp is demonstrated to be a significant degrader of hydrogen peroxide in anoxic Escherichia coli. Intriguingly, ccp transcription requires both the presence of H2O2 and the absence of O2. Experiments show that Ccp lacks enough activity to shield the cytoplasm from exogenous H2O2. However, it receives electrons from the quinone pool, and its flux rate approximates flow to other anaerobic electron acceptors. Indeed, Ccp enabled E. coli to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source when H2O2 was supplied. Salmonella behaved similarly. This role rationalizes ccp repression in oxic environments. We speculate that micromolar H2O2 is created both biologically and abiotically at natural oxic/anoxic interfaces. The OxyR response appears to exploit this H2O2 as a terminal oxidant while simultaneously defending the cell against its toxicity.},

These photochemical transformations generate a suite of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including the superoxide anion, the hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, alkoxy and peroxy radicals, the carbonate radical, and hydrogen peroxide, ROS cause numerous biogeochemical changes in aquatic ecosystems affecting the cycling of DOM, biological processes, and trace metal speciation. In this chapter, we present a synthesis of research conducted in the study of ROS in marine and fresh waters, including a detailed discussion of recent evidence regarding the formation and removal of these compounds in the photic zone, Salient findings of this review are: (I) direct photolysis of DOM and reactions of DOM with trace metals and dissolved oxygen are one of the main sources of ROS in aquatic environments; (2) solar action spectra for ROS indicate that the highest production rates are between 290-400 nm; (3) removal pathways for most ROS are poorly known, but are likely to occur through reactions with DOM, Hydrogen peroxide is relatively unreactive towards DOM; however. it can affect DOM indirectly through photo-Fenton reactions; and (4) the impact of externally-generated ROS on aquatic organisms should be a function of their permeability through the cell membrane and inversely related to their reactivity in the water outside the cell.},

  abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), that is, members of the Thaumarchaeota phylum, occur ubiquitously in the environment and are of major significance for global nitrogen cycling. However, controls on cell growth and organic carbon assimilation by AOA are poorly understood. We isolated an ammonia-oxidizing archaeon (designated strain DDS1) from seawater and used this organism to study the physiology of ammonia oxidation. These findings were confirmed using four additional Thaumarchaeota strains from both marine and terrestrial habitats. Ammonia oxidation by strain DDS1 was enhanced in coculture with other bacteria, as well as in artificial seawater media supplemented with {$\alpha$}-keto acids (e.g., pyruvate, oxaloacetate). {$\alpha$}-Keto acid-enhanced activity of AOA has previously been interpreted as evidence of mixotrophy. However, assays for heterotrophic growth indicated that incorporation of pyruvate into archaeal membrane lipids was negligible. Lipid carbon atoms were, instead, derived from dissolved inorganic carbon, indicating strict autotrophic growth. {$\alpha$}-Keto acids spontaneously detoxify H2O2 via a nonenzymatic decarboxylation reaction, suggesting a role of {$\alpha$}-keto acids as H2O2 scavengers. Indeed, agents that also scavenge H2O2, such as dimethylthiourea and catalase, replaced the {$\alpha$}-keto acid requirement, enhancing growth of strain DDS1. In fact, in the absence of {$\alpha$}-keto acids, strain DDS1 and other AOA isolates were shown to endogenously produce H2O2 (up to {$\sim$}4.5 {$\mu$}M), which was inhibitory to growth. Genomic analyses indicated catalase genes are largely absent in the AOA. Our results indicate that AOA broadly feature strict autotrophic nutrition and implicate H2O2 as an important factor determining the activity, evolution, and community ecology of AOA ecotypes.},

When exposed to a singlet oxygen-producing system composed of rose bengal (RB) and visible light, ICDH was susceptible to oxidative modification and damage as indicated by the loss of activity and by the formation of carbonyl groups. The structural alterations of modified enzyme were indicated by the increase in susceptibility to proteases and the change in intrinsic fluorescence spectra. Upon exposure to photoactivated RB, a significant decrease in both cytosolic and mitochondrial ICDH activities was observed in HL-60 cells. The singlet oxygen-mediated damage to ICDH may result in the perturbation of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms and subsequently lead to a pro-oxidant condition. When we examined the antioxidant role of cytosolic ICDH against singlet oxygen-induced damage with HL-60 cells transfected with the cDNA for mouse cytosolic ICDH in sense and antisense orientations, a clear inverse relationship was observed between the amount of cytosolic ICDH expressed in target cells and their susceptibility to singlet oxygen-mediated oxidative damage.},

Although several lines of evidence suggest that ROS are involved in the mortality of fish exposed to C. marina, the mechanism of ROS generation in C. marina remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that the cell-free supernatant prepared from C. marina cells showed NAD(P)H-dependent O2- generation, and this response was inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of mammalian NADPH oxidase. When the cell-free supernatant of C. marina was analyzed by immunoblotting using antibody raised against the human neutrophil cytochrome b558 large subunit (gp91phox), a main band of approximately 110 kDa was detected. The cell surface localization of the epitope recognized with this antibody was also demonstrated in C. marina by indirect immunofluorescence. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis performed on genomic DNA of C. marina with a probe covering the C-terminal region of gp91phox suggested the presence of a single-copy gene coding for gp91phox homologous protein in C. marina. These results provide evidence for the involvement of an enzymatic system analogous to the neutrophil NADPH oxidase as a source of O2- production in C. marina.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that C. marina and C. ovata continuously produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion (O2-) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under normal growth conditions, and an ROS-mediated toxic mechanism against fish and other marine organisms has been proposed. Although the exact mechanism of ROS generation in these phytoplankters still remains to be clarified, our previous study suggested that NADPH oxidase-like enzyme located on the cell surface of C. marina may be involved in O2- generation. To investigate the localization of O2- and H2O2 generation in C. marina and C. ovata, we employed 2-methyl-6(p-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-one and 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2{${'}$},7{${'}$}-dichlorodihydrodihydrofluorescein dictate, acetyl ester, which are specific fluorescent probe for detecting O2- and H2O2, respectively. Observation by fluorescence microscopy of live phytoplankters incubated with each probe revealed that O2- is mainly generated on the cell surface, whereas H2O2 is generated in the intracellular compartment in these phytoplankters. When the cells were ruptured by ultrasonic treatment, O2- levels of C. marina and C. ovata decreased significantly, whereas a few times higher levels of H2O2 were detected in the ruptured cell suspensions when compared with the levels of the live cell suspension. In immunoblotting analysis, the protein recognized by anti-human gp91 phox was detected in both species. These results suggest that, in both phytoplankters, the underlying mechanisms of O2- and H2O2 generation may be distinct and such systems are independently operating in the cells.},

  abstract = {Singlet oxygen (1O2)-mediated signaling has been established in the conditional fluorescent (flu) mutant of Arabidopsis. In the dark, the flu mutant accumulates free protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a photosensitizer that in the light generates 1O2. The release of 1O2 leads to growth inhibition of mature plants and bleaching of seedlings. These 1O2-mediated responses depend on two plastid proteins, EXECUTER (EX) 1 and 2. An ex1/ex2/flu mutant accumulates in the dark Pchlide and upon illumination generates similar amounts of 1O2 as flu, but 1O2-mediated responses are abrogated in the triple mutant. The 1O2- and EX-dependent signaling pathway operates also in wild type placed under light stress. However, it does not act alone as in flu, but interacts with other signaling pathways that modulate 1O2-mediated responses. Depending on how severe the light stress is, 1O2- and EX-dependent signaling may be superimposed by 1O2-mediated signaling that does not depend on EX and is associated with photo-oxidative damage. Because of its high reactivity and short half-life, 1O2 is unlikely to be a signal that is translocated across the chloroplast envelope, but is likely to interact with other plastid components close to its site of production and to generate more stable signaling molecules during this interaction. Depending on the site of 1O2 production and the severity of stress, different signaling molecules may be expected that give rise to different 1O2-mediated responses.},

A numerical kinetic model of the analytical method has been developed to optimize analytical performance.  Measurements of antioxidant concentrations in pure and seawater are possible with detection limits below 0.1 nM.    Surface seawater samples collected at solar noon contained over 0.4 nM of antioxidants and exhibited first-order decay with a half-life of 3-7 minutes, consistent with a reactive species capable of scavenging photochemically produced superoxide.},

The antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and catalase were analyzed biochemically. Catalase and CuZn superoxide dismutase were localized by immunocytochemistry. To enable investigation of the glutathione redox cycle and catalase pathways, glutathione reductase was inactivated with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and catalase was inactivated with aminotriazole. When the cells were exposed to a low, sublethal (0.030 mM) H2O2 concentration, glutathione reductase but not catalase inactivation resulted in a decreased capacity to remove H2O2 from the extracellular medium. When the cells were exposed to a high (0.25 mM) H2O2 concentration, H2O2-scavenging capacity decreased remarkably when catalase was inactivated. When the cells were exposed to 0.1 to 0.5 mM H2O2, cell cytotoxicity (lactate dehydrogenase release) increased significantly if glutathione reductase was inactivated; catalase inactivation resulted in a significant cytotoxicity only at high (greater than or equal to 0.25 mM) H2O2 concentrations. Immunocytochemical studies showed that the cells, both in situ and in vitro, contained low amounts of catalase. This suggests that the results of the catalase-inhibition studies are probably not due to a change in the characteristics of the cells in culture. 3-Aminobenzamide is a compound that is known to prevent NAD depletion through inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase during oxidant stress. When intact cells were treated with different antioxidants and exposed to 0.5 mM H2O2, both catalase and 3-aminobenzamide protected the cells completely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these trophic shifts in Symbiodiniaceae are still largely unknown. Using Breviolum minutum strain SSB01 (designated SSB01) as a model, we showed that Symbiodiniaceae go through a physiological and transcriptome reprogramming when the alga is grown with the organic nitrogen containing nutrients in hydrolyzed casein, but not with inorganic nutrients. SSB01 grows at a much faster rate and maintains stable photosynthetic efficiency when supplemented with casein amino acids compared to only inorganic nutrients or seawater. These physiological changes are driven by massive transcriptome changes in SSB01 supplemented with casein amino acids. The levels of transcripts encoding proteins involved in altering DNA conformation such as DNA topoisomerases, histones, and chromosome structural components were all significantly changed. Functional enrichment analysis also revealed processes involved in translation, ion transport, generation of second messengers, and phosphorylation. The physiological and molecular changes that underlie in vitro trophic transitions in Symbiodiniaceae can serve as an orthogonal platform to further understand the factors that impact the Symbiodiniaceae lifestyle.},

We have identified seven cDNAs and genes for SOD in Arabidopsis. These consist of three CuZnSODs (CSD1, CSD2, and CSD3), three FeSODs (FSD1, FSD2, and FSD3), and one MnSOD (MSD1). The chromosomal location of these seven SOD genes has been established. To study this enzyme family, antibodies were generated against five proteins: CSD1, CSD2, CSD3, FSD1, and MSD1. Using these antisera and nondenaturing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enzyme assays, we identified protein and activity for two CuZnSODs and for FeSOD and MnSOD in Arabidopsis rosette tissue. Additionally, subcellular fractionation studies revealed the presence of CSD2 and FeSOD protein within Arabidopsis chloroplasts. The seven SOD mRNAs and the four proteins identified were differentially regulated in response to various light regimes, ozone fumigation, and ultraviolet-B irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a large-scale analysis of the regulation of multiple SOD proteins in a plant species.},

  abstract = {Fragilariopsis kerguelensis is one of the most abundant diatoms in the sediments of the Southern Ocean. Its morphometric features have been proposed as proxies, based on links with, for example, iron availability, sea surface temperature and glacial/interglacial conditions. We investigated morphometric changes in F. kerguelensis valves in a well-studied sediment core record, focusing on transition periods between glacials and interglacials. By applying a high-throughput diatom imaging and morphometry workflow, we found two clearly distinct morphotypes which were differentiated by their rectangularity. One of them occurred preferentially in glacial samples, whilst the other persisted throughout. This indicates that their relative abundances depend on environmental conditions and thereby points to the possibility that paleo-proxies based on F. kerguelensis valve morphometric features might in the future benefit from differentiating these two morphotypes. As an initial exploration of this idea, we show that the abundance ratio of both morphotypes correlates well with paleo-temperatures which had been reconstructed using independent data from the same core. Distinguishing between the two morphotypes only became possible by image analysis for precisely measuring diatom valve outlines and area, highlighting the potential of such methods for diatom analyses.},

The increase in formation of dichlorofluorescein by methyl viologen (superoxide anion radical generator) was linear for 2 h in immature cyst cells (low astaxanthin) in a methyl viologen-concentration-dependent manner, while no production was detected in mature (high astaxanthin) cysts. Compared to cyst cells, formation of dichlorofluorescein in vegetative cells (no astaxanthin) was markedly increased by methyl viologen. The formation of dichlorofluorescein in cyst cells was decreased with higher astaxanthin content under excessive oxidative stress. All of the active oxygen species tested (singlet oxygen, superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and peroxy radical) at 10-3 M increased the intracellular dichlorofluorescein formation in immature cysts, but did not increase the dichlorofluorescein content of mature cysts.

We found that cell aggregation occured as the natural response of a healthy, well-growing culture to a sudden increase in irradiance. We propose that aggregation represents a fast (time scale in minutes), light-adapting mechanism, affected by both light quality and the presence of substances altering photosynthetic electron transfer. Our data suggest an involvement of electron transfer downstream of PSI, with reactive oxygen species triggering the signal. Aggregation was an ATP-independent process and did not require de novo protein synthesis. We suggest a specific role of glutathione in this process based on its ability to induce aggregation in the dark.},

  abstract = {Many gram-negative bacteria harbor a copper/zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in their periplasms. In pathogenic bacteria, one role of this enzyme may be to protect periplasmic biomolecules from superoxide that is released by host phagocytic cells. However, the enzyme is also present in many nonpathogens and/or free-living bacteria, including Escherichia coli. In this study we were able to detect superoxide being released into the medium from growing cultures of E. coli. Exponential-phase cells do not normally synthesize CuZnSOD, which is specifically induced in stationary phase. However, the engineered expression of CuZnSOD in growing cells eliminated superoxide release, confirming that this superoxide was formed within the periplasm. The rate of periplasmic superoxide production was surprisingly high and approximated the estimated rate of cytoplasmic superoxide formation when both were normalized to the volume of the compartment. The rate increased in proportion to oxygen concentration, suggesting that the superoxide is generated by the adventitious oxidation of an electron carrier. Mutations that eliminated menaquinone synthesis eradicated the superoxide formation, while mutations in genes encoding respiratory complexes affected it only insofar as they are likely to affect the redox state of menaquinone. We infer that the adventitious autoxidation of dihydromenaquinone in the cytoplasmic membrane releases a steady flux of superoxide into the periplasm of E. coli. This endogenous superoxide may create oxidative stress in that compartment and be a primary substrate of CuZnSOD.}

  abstract = {Superoxide is a key component of the antibacterial weaponry of phagocytes. Presumably, for this rea-son, strains of Salmonella typhimurium express a periplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) that is essential for full virulence. Because most anions cannot easily penetrate lipid membranes, it is thought that the phagosomal superoxide either damages an unknown target on the bacterial surface or reacts with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite (HOONO), a toxic oxidant that can freely enter bacteria. However, in this study, we tested whether superoxide itself could penetrate membranes. Superoxide that was generated at high pH ({$>$}7.5) very slowly reduced cytochrome c that was encapsulated inside lipid vesicles. It did so much more quickly at lower pH ({$<$}7). Under the latter conditions, more superoxide was protonated and uncharged (HO2{$\cdot$}), and the penetrance of superoxide was proportional to the concentration of this species. The permeability coefficient of HO2{$\cdot$} was determined to be 9 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 4 cm sec\textendash 1, just slightly lower than that of water and far higher than the value of the anionic form (O2\textendash, {$<$}10\textendash 7 cm sec\textendash 1). When Escherichia coli mutants that lack periplasmic SOD were exposed to super-oxide at pH 6.5, cytosolic fumarase B was damaged. Damage was minimal at higher pH or in strains that contained periplasmic SOD. Thus, in the acidic phagolysosome, superoxide may be able to penetrate and attack cytosolic targets of captive bacteria. This process may contribute to the potency of the oxidative burst. One role of periplasmic SOD may be to avert this damage. In contrast, periplasmic SOD was ineffective at lowering the extracellular super-oxide concentration and, therefore, may have little impact upon HOONO formation.},

The photosynthetic performance of E. agilis was recorded after exposure of between 15 and 60min followed by a period of recovery lasting 6\textendash 24h under dim light (5\textendash 10{$\mu$}molphotonsm-2s-1). The maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm) was reduced to 65\% and 14\% of initial values immediately following 15 and 30min UV-B exposure, but recovered to 100 and 86\% of the initials, respectively. Values of rETRmax in E. agilis exposed to 15min UV-B were similar to those of the initials, but a 30min UV exposure resulted in 75\% reduction of rETRmax with only a 43\% recovery as compared with the initial after 24h recovery. After a 60min UV-B exposure, there were no Chl a fluorescence signals, and hence no Fv/Fm or rETRmax. A UV dose-dependent increase in DCFH-DA fluorescence was found in E. agilis cells, reflecting an increase in ROS production. After exposures to UV-B for between 15 and 60min, the percentages of motile cells in the population decreased to 76, 39 and 15\%, respectively.

After periods of time in dim light (6, 12 and 24h) velocities had recovered to between 44 and 81\% of the initial value. In untreated controls, the r-value was 0.23, indicating random movement of E. agilis, but it increased to 0.35 and 0.72 after exposure to UV-B for 30 and 60min, respectively. There was a tendency towards vertical downward movement of cells proportional to the duration of exposure. The compactness of E. agilis decreased from 2.9 in controls to 1.8\textendash 2.3 in cells treated with UV-B although significant recovery followed.

At low light intensity, increasing Fd concentration from 5 to 30~{$\mu$}M in the absence of NADP+ increased the proportion of oxygen reduction by Fd from 25\textendash 35 to 40\textendash 60\% in different experiments.

At high light intensity, the overall oxygen reduction rates in the presence of Fd~+~NADP+ and in the presence of Fd alone were comparable. The significance of reduction of dioxygen either by water-soluble Fd or by the membrane-bound carriers of the photosynthetic electron transport chain for redox signaling under different light intensities is discussed.},

O2 molecule has a great potential to accept electrons from the components of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain (PETC) (so-called the Mehler reaction). Here we overview the Mehler reaction mechanisms, specifying the changes in the structure of the PETC of oxygenic phototrophs that probably had occurred as the result of evolutionary pressure to minimize the electron flow to O2. These changes are warranted by the fact that the efficient electron flow to O2 would decrease the quantum yield of photosynthesis. Moreover, the reduction of O2 leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely, the superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide, which cause oxidative stress to plant cells if they are accumulated at a significant amount. From another side, hydrogen peroxide acts as a signaling molecule. We particularly zoom in into the role of photosystem I (PSI) and the plastoquinone (PQ) pool in the Mehler reaction.},

  abstract = {Lesser Flamingo, the flagship species of saline wetlands of Africa and India, is a specialised feeder subsisting on microscopic cyanobacteria and algae. To establish the relationship between flamingo occurrence and food algal abundance and quality, an extensive microphyte survey in more than 150 sampling trips to seven countries over a 15-years period (2001\textendash 2015) was carried out. The 44 habitat sites included the core soda lakes in eastern Africa (Bogoria, Nakuru, Elmentaita, Oloidien), where the highest numbers of flamingos were observed, and five breeding sites in eastern and southern Africa as well as in north-western India. A reference describing the diversity of microphytes was established including members of three orders of cyanobacteria and nine orders of eukaryotic algae that potentially could act as food source for Lesser Flamingos. Preferred food organisms consisted of filamentous cyanobacteria, mainly Arthrospira, as well as benthic diatoms. Further investigation on the suitability of other microphytes as alternative flamingo diet revealed the food potential of chlorophytes and euglenophytes. This paper discusses a phycological perspective in the feeding ecology of Lesser Flamingos. The survey findings can assist scientists and conservationists in evaluating the potential of wetlands to support flocks of this endangered bird.},

Recent studies have found that Picocystis occasionally replaces the dominant cyanobacterium (Arthrospira fusiformis), which is the main food resource of Lesser Flamingos, in soda lakes of Bogoria and Nakuru. This article discusses the consequences of a high abundance (maximum cell numbers of {$>$} 3 billion cells l-1) of Picocystis on food chains of African saline waters. During the study, we found a new morphotype of Picocystis characterized by larger cell sizes and absence of lobes in hot springs near Lake Magadi. SSU rRNA genes of Picocystis strains and uncultured field clones collected from Lake Nakuru were subjected to phylogenetic analyses together with other picoplankton from field and culture samples from saline, marine or freshwater. Picocystis salinarum from saline inland waters represents a link between marine and freshwater habitats from both an ecological and a phylogenetic point of view and is therefore of great interest.},

  abstract = {Background The diversity of the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp., as assessed by genetic markers, is well established. To what extent this diversity is reflected on the amino acid level of functional genes such as enzymatic antioxidants that play an important role in thermal stress tolerance of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis is, however, unknown. Here we present a predicted structural analysis and phylogenetic characterization of the enzymatic antioxidant repertoire of the genus Symbiodinium. We also report gene expression and enzymatic activity under short-term thermal stress in Symbiodinium of the B1 genotype. Results Based on eight different ITS2 types, covering six clades, multiple protein isoforms for three of the four investigated antioxidants (ascorbate peroxidase [APX], catalase peroxidase [KatG], manganese superoxide dismutase [MnSOD]) are present in the genus Symbiodinium. Amino acid sequences of both SOD metalloforms (Fe/Mn), as well as KatG, exhibited a number of prokaryotic characteristics that were also supported by the protein phylogeny. In contrast to the bacterial form, KatG in Symbiodinium is characterized by extended functionally important loops and a shortened C-terminal domain. Intercladal sequence variations were found to be much higher in both peroxidases, compared to SODs. For APX, these variable residues involve binding sites for substrates and cofactors, and might therefore differentially affect the catalytic properties of this enzyme between clades. While expression of antioxidant genes was successfully measured in Symbiodinium B1, it was not possible to assess the link between gene expression and protein activity due to high variability in expression between replicates, and little response in their enzymatic activity over the three-day experimental period. Conclusions The genus Symbiodinium has a diverse enzymatic antioxidant repertoire that has similarities to prokaryotes, potentially as a result of horizontal gene transfer or events of secondary endosymbiosis. Different degrees of sequence evolution between SODs and peroxidases might be the result of potential selective pressure on the conserved molecular function of SODs as the first line of defence. In contrast, genetic redundancy of hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes might permit the observed variations in peroxidase sequences. Our data and successful measurement of antioxidant gene expression in Symbiodinium will serve as basis for further studies of coral health.

Beyond quantifying gene expression, the data generated by RNA-Seq facilitate the discovery of novel transcripts, identification of alternatively spliced genes, and detection of allele-specific expression. Recent advances in the RNA-Seq workflow, from sample preparation to library construction to data analysis, have enabled researchers to further elucidate the functional complexity of the transcription. In addition to polyadenylated messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, RNA-Seq can be applied to investigate different populations of RNA, including total RNA, pre-mRNA, and noncoding RNA, such as microRNA and long ncRNA.

Moreover, little is known about its role in cellular redox stress. Utilizing electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping we measured the role of AO in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the oxidation of NADH, and the effects of inhibitors of AO on NADH-mediated superoxide ( O2\textbullet -) generation. NADH was found to be a good substrate for AO with apparent Km and Vmax values of 29{$\mu$}M and 12 nmol min-1 mg-1, respectively. From  O2\textbullet - generation measurements by cytochrome c reduction the apparent Km and Vmax values of NADH for AO were 11 {$\mu$}M and 15 nmol min-1 mg-1, respectively. With NADH oxidation by AO, {$\geq$}65\% of the total electron flux led to  O2\textbullet - generation. Diphenyleneiodonium completely inhibited AO-mediated  O2\textbullet - production confirming that this occurs at the FAD site. Inhibitors of this NADH-derived  O2\textbullet - generation were studied with amidone the most potent exerting complete inhibition at 100 {$\mu$}M concentration, while 150 {$\mu$}M menadione, raloxifene or {$\beta$}-estradiol led to 81\%, 46\% or 26\% inhibition, respectively. From the kinetic data, the levels of AO and NADH,  O2\textbullet - production was estimated to be \textasciitilde 89 and \textasciitilde 4 nM/s in liver and heart, respectively, much higher than that estimated for XOR under similar conditions. Owing to the ubiquitous distribution of NADH, aldehydes, and other endogenous AO substrates, AO is predicted to have an important role in cellular redox stress and related disease pathogenesis.},

In EDTA-buffered media with 45 pmol L-1 iron (Fe)(III)', over half the Fe(III) reduction is mediated by extracellular O2- production. Surprisingly, even though we saw a consistent inhibition of Fe reduction by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and enhancement of Fe reduction due to superoxide production using the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system (X-XO), we observed no effect of SOD or X-XO on Fe uptake in these cultures. We also observed no effect of SOD on the uptake of Fe from either ferrihydrite, an Fe-labeled porphyrin, or as regenerated by metazoan grazers. Our data reveal that Fe(II)' is formed by O2- via the reduction of Fe(III)' rather than by the reduction and dissociation of FeEDTA complexes in EDTA-buffered media. This bulk-phase reduction of Fe(III)' by O2- is a ``futile'' reductive step, as the Fe(II)' formed is rapidly reoxidized to Fe(III)' in pH 8 oxygenated seawater.},

The responses in growth, elemental composition, pigmentation and photophysiology were followed over 120 h and are discussed together with underlying gene expression patterns. Stress response and subsequent re-acclimation were efficiently facilitated by T. hyalina, which showed only moderate changes in photophysiology and elemental composition, and thrived under high light after 120 h. In N. frigida, photochemical damage and oxidative stress appeared to outweigh cellular defenses, causing dysfunctional photophysiology and reduced growth. pCO2 alone did not specifically influence gene expression, but amplified the transcriptomic reactions to light stress, indicating that pCO2 affects metabolic equilibria rather than sensitive genes. Large differences in acclimation capacities towards high light and high pCO2 between T. hyalina and N. frigida indicate species-specific mechanisms in coping with the two stressors, which may reflect their respective ecological niches. This could potentially alter the balance between sympagic and pelagic primary production in a future Arctic.},

Hydrogen peroxide production and scavenging also display time-of-day phases.

Mis-expression of EARLY FLOWERING 3, LUX ARRHYTHMO, and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 affect ROS production and transcription, indicating a global effect of the clock on the ROS network. We propose CCA1 as a master regulator of ROS homeostasis through association with the Evening Element in promoters of ROS genes in vivo to coordinate time-dependent responses to oxidative stress. We also find that ROS functions as an input signal that affects the transcriptional output of the clock, revealing an important link between ROS signaling and circadian output. Temporal coordination of ROS signaling by CCA1 and the reciprocal control of circadian output by ROS reveal a mechanistic link that allows plants to master oxidative stress responses.},

For each integer k there is one branch, denoted by Wk(z), which is a complex-valued function of one complex argument. W0 is known as the principal branch. These functions have the following property: if z and w are any complex numbers, then                        w                    e                        w                             =         z                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle we\^\{w\}=z\}   holds if and only if                        w         =                    W                        k                             (         z         )                                         for some integer                   k         .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle w=W\_\{k\}(z)\textbackslash{} \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash text\{ for some integer \}\}k.\}   When dealing with real numbers only, the two branches W0 and W-1 suffice: for real numbers x and y the equation                        y                    e                        y                             =         x                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle ye\^\{y\}=x\}   can be solved for y only if x {$\geq$} -1/e; we get y = W0(x) if x {$\geq$} 0 and the two values y = W0(x) and y = W-1(x) if -1/e {$\leq$} x {$<$} 0. The Lambert W relation cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. It is useful in combinatorics, for instance, in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose\textendash Einstein, and Fermi\textendash Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as y{${'}$}(t) = a y(t - 1). In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, an opened-form solution for the time-course kinetics analysis of Michaelis\textendash Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.},

Subsurface pulses of nutrients likely fuel brief episodes of diatom growth, but the exact mechanisms utilized by diatoms in response to these nutrient injections remain understudied within near-natural settings. Here we simulated delivery of subsurface nutrients and compare the response among eukaryotic phytoplankton using a combination of physiological techniques and metatranscriptomics. We show that eukaryotic phytoplankton groups exhibit differing levels of transcriptional responsiveness and expression of orthologous genes in response to release from nutrient limitation. In particular, strategies for use of newly delivered nutrients are distinct among phytoplankton groups. Diatoms channel new nitrate to growth-related strategies while physiological measurements and gene expression patterns of other groups suggest alternative strategies. The gene expression patterns displayed here provide insights into the cellular mechanisms that underlie diatom subsistence during chronic nitrogen-depleted conditions and growth upon nutrient delivery that can enhance carbon export from the surface ocean.},

  abstract = {Sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) is known as a strongly damaging air pollutant. After conversion to sulphite in aqueous solution, it becomes a strong nucleophilic agent that attacks numerous compounds in the cell. Therefore, plants have developed a mechanism to control sulphite levels. Recently, we have cloned and characterized the enzyme sulphite oxidase (SO) from Arabidopsis thaliana. Yet, its physiological role remained unclear. Here, we describe results demonstrating that SO is essential for detoxifying excessive amounts of sulphite in the cell which is important for the survival of the plant. T-DNA-tagged A. thaliana plants lacking the enzyme showed a decrease in vitality during SO(2) fumigation and a change in their S-metabolites. The same was found with RNA-interference (RNAi) plants that were generated for tobacco. On the contrary, over-expression of SO helped the plant to survive SO(2) concentrations that are detrimental for non-transformed wild-type (WT) plants, as was shown with poplar plants which are known to be particularly sensitive to SO(2). Fumigation induced the expression of the enzyme as demonstrated by promoter-reporter gene fusion, by immunoblot analysis of SO-protein and by induction of enzyme activity. This implies that SO, as an otherwise constitutively expressed protein, is under additional control by SO(2) in the environment.},

NADPH oxidases (NOX) are plasma-membrane enzymes that transport electrons from the cytosol to generate extracellular superoxide anions, and have been implicated in BPV output. In this study, we investigated NOX activity in the diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana in an attempt to understand and enhance NOX and BPV function. We found that NOX activity was linked to defined growth regimes and growth phases, and was light dependent. Crucially, current output in a BPV device correlated with NOX activity, and levels of up to 14{$\mu$}A per 106 cells (approximately 500mA{$\cdot$}m-2) were obtained. Expression of two putative P. tricornutum NOX genes (PtNOX1 and PtNOX2) was found to correspond with the observed growth patterns of superoxide anion production and power output, suggesting that these are responsible for the observed patterns of NOX activity. Crucially, we demonstrate that NOX activity levels could be enhanced via semi-continuous culturing, pointing to the possibility of maintaining long-term power output in BPV devices.},

We examined high light (HL) adapted Prochlorococcus communities across spatial and temporal environmental gradients in the Pacific Ocean to determine the ecological drivers of population structure and diversity across taxonomic ranks. We show that the Prochlorococcus community has the highest diversity at low latitudes, but seasonality driven by temperature, day length and nutrients adds complexity. At finer taxonomic resolution, some `sub-ecotype' clades have unique, cohesive responses to environmental variables and distinct biogeographies, suggesting that presently defined ecotypes can be further partitioned into ecologically meaningful units. Intriguingly, biogeographies of the HL-I sub-ecotypes are driven by unique combinations of environmental traits, rather than through trait hierarchy, while the HL-II sub-ecotypes appear ecologically similar, thus demonstrating differences among these dominant HL ecotypes. Examining biodiversity across taxonomic ranks reveals high-resolution dynamics of Prochlorococcus evolution and ecology that are masked at phylogenetically coarse resolution. Spatial and seasonal trends of Prochlorococcus communities suggest that the future ocean may be comprised of different populations, with implications for ecosystem structure and function.},

The presence of an oxygen-depleted layer at intermediate depths, which also impinges on the seafloor and in some cases the euphotic zone, plays a significant role in structuring both pelagic and benthic communities, and also in the vertical partitioning of microbial assemblages. Here, we assessed the genetic diversity and distribution of natural populations of the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus within oxic and suboxic waters of the eastern tropical Pacific using cloning and sequencing, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses applied to the 16S\textendash 23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region. With the T-RFLP approach we could discriminate 19 cyanobacterial clades, of which 18 were present in the study region. Synechococcus was more abundant in the surface oxic waters of the eastern South Pacific, while Prochlorococcus dominated the subsurface low-oxygen waters. Two of the dominant clades in the oxygen-deficient waters belong to novel and yet uncultivated lineages of low-light adapted Prochlorococcus.},

  abstract = {Planktonic diatoms exhibit high biodiversity in marine systems and make a significant contribution to water column primary productivity. This makes research on planktonic diatoms particularly important in measuring the health of coastal marine ecosystems. At the University of San Francisco (USF), undergraduate research has been conducted since September 2015 to study planktonic diatoms in San Francisco Bay. A previous study by Keith (2018), Planktonic Diatom Species Succession in San Francisco Bay, documented changes in species diversity over time, observing seasonal patterns in species richness as well as the effect of environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, and rainfall on species succession. In her work, an abundance of centric diatoms was present, indicating their essential role in local phytoplankton communities; however, the majority of observed centric taxa could not be identified with light microscopy. The current project was intended to use scanning electron microscopy to examine phenotypic characteristics of cells from field collections of Keith (2018) and clonal cultures to identify the species that make up the assemblage of dominant centric diatoms. Five centric diatom species were identified prior to the COVID-19 pandemic: Coscinodiscus curvatulus, Actinoptychus senarius, Coscinodiscus oculus-iridis, Coscinodiscus lentiginosa, and Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii. However, due to temporary sampling site closures and limited access to laboratories because of stay-at-home orders from the pandemic, the project was modified to be done remotely. The project was modified to analyze and compile present literature on diatom taxonomy based on morphology and develop taxonomic keys specific to diatoms in San Francisco Bay for use by both specialists and non-specialists, including school-aged children. In the construction of the keys, genera and species were considered significant if they were observed in {$\geq$}50\% of the samples in the study by Keith (2018) from September 2015 - December 2017, including Chaetoceros spp., Ditylum brightwelli, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Rhizosolenia setigera, Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiosira spp., and Trieres mobiliensis. Here, two keys are constructed \textendash{} ``A Technical Key to Common Planktonic Diatoms in San Francisco Bay'' and "A Basic Key to Common Phytoplankton in San Francisco Bay'' \textendash{} and the challenges of constructing the keys are discussed. These keys will aid in the assessment of diatom biodiversity in San Francisco Bay. Additionally, open-source diatom taxonomy websites have been collected to further support specialists and non-specialists in their scientific education and study of phytoplankton.},

Analysis of Tara Oceans data, together with literature review, reveal a general oversight of the significance of these small diatoms at the global scale.

  abstract = {In an aerobic environment, responding to oxidative cues is critical for physiological adaptation (acclimation) to changing environmental conditions. The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was tested for the ability to acclimate to specific forms of oxidative stress. Acclimation was defined as the ability of a sublethal pretreatment with a reactive oxygen species to activate defense responses that subsequently enhance survival of that stress. C. reinhardtii exhibited a strong acclimation response to rose bengal, a photosensitizing dye that produces singlet oxygen. This acclimation was dependent upon photosensitization and occurred only when pretreatment was administered in the light. Shifting cells from low light to high light also enhanced resistance to singlet oxygen, suggesting an overlap in high-light and singlet oxygen response pathways. Microarray analysis of RNA levels indicated that a relatively small number of genes respond to sublethal levels of singlet oxygen. Constitutive overexpression of either of two such genes, a glutathione peroxidase gene and a glutathione S-transferase gene, was sufficient to enhance singlet oxygen resistance. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit well-defined responses to reactive oxygen but did not acclimate to singlet oxygen, possibly reflecting the relative importance of singlet oxygen stress for photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract = {The dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium contains numerous genetically distinct lineages that appear `morphologically cryptic'. However, detailed morphological assessments of plate formulae visible in the motile phase (mastigote) of two distantly related Symbiodinium spp., representing Clades `A' and `E', were recently shown to be different. While there are several formally described species in Clade A, genetic evidence indicates that many more remain uncharacterized. We focused on closely related phylogenetic lineages within this group to examine whether differences in morphology can be used together with genetic and ecological evidence to describe new species. We found fixed differences in nuclear (internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit rDNA), chloroplast (cp23S) and mitochondrial (cob) gene sequences from cultured and field-collected samples of Symbiodinium microadriaticum (sensu Trench \& Blank, 1987) and Symbiodinium sp. associated predominantly with giant clams and Pacific Cassiopea jellyfish (comprising members of the ITS2 A3 lineage, sensu LaJeunesse 2001). Amphiesmal plate tabulations were formulated for the strain of S. microadriaticum (CCMP2464) used by Trench \& Blank (1987) in their emended description, and two strains of type A3 (CCMP832 and rt-272) cultured from Indo-Pacific giant clams in the subfamily Tridacninae. The Kofoidian plate formula for type A3 consists of the small plate (x), the elongated amphiesmal vesicle (EAV), 5\$'\$, 6a, 8\$''\$, 9\textendash 11s, a 2-row cingulum, 7\$'''\$ and 3\$''''\$ (and occasionally 2\$''''\$), and is different from S. microadriaticum, which has a plate formula of x, EAV, 4\$'\$, 5a, 8\$''\$, 9\textendash 13s, a 2-row cingulum, 6\$'''\$ and 2\$''''\$. Based on morphological and genetic comparisons, we recognized Symbiodinium tridacnidorum sp. nov., a new Indo-Pacific species. The plate arrangement exhibited by S. microadriaticum appears to be more similar to the distantly related S. natans (also in Clade A). When the tabulations for all three Clade A species are compared with S. voratum (Clade E), the amount of morphological differentiation between species does not correspond to their degree of genetic divergence.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by the mammalian host defense to kill invading bacteria and limit bacterial colonization. One main in vivo target of ROS is the thiol group of proteins. We have developed a quantitative thiol trapping technique termed OxICAT to identify physiologically important target proteins of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorite (NaOCl) stress in vivo. OxICAT allows the precise quantification of oxidative thiol modifications in hundreds of different proteins in a single experiment. It also identifies the affected proteins and defines their redox-sensitive cysteine(s). Using this technique, we identified a group of Escherichia coli proteins with significantly (30\textendash 90\%) oxidatively modified thiol groups, which appear to be specifically sensitive to either H2O2 or NaOCl stress. These results indicate that individual oxidants target distinct proteins in vivo. Conditionally essential E. coli genes encode one-third of redox-sensitive proteins, a finding that might explain the bacteriostatic effect of oxidative stress treatment. We identified a select group of redox-regulated proteins, which protect E. coli against oxidative stress conditions. These experiments illustrate that OxICAT, which can be used in a variety of different cell types and organisms, is a powerful tool to identify, quantify, and monitor oxidative thiol modifications in vivo.},

  abstract = {We purified an intracellular pyranose oxidase from mycelial extracts of the white rot fungus Trametes multicolor by using ammonium sulfate fractionation, hydrophobic interaction, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The native enzyme has a molecular mass of 270 kDa as determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and is composed of four identical 68-kDa subunits as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Each subunit contains one covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide as its prosthetic group. The enzyme oxidizes several aldopyranoses specifically at position C-2, and its preferred electron donor substrates are d-glucose, d-xylose, and l-sorbose. During this oxidation reaction electrons are transferred to oxygen, yielding hydrogen peroxide. In addition, the enzyme catalyzes the two-electron reduction of 1,4-benzoquinone, several substituted benzoquinones, and 2,6-dichloroindophenol, as well as the one-electron reduction of the ABTS [2,2{${'}$}-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)] cation radical. As judged by the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km), some of these quinone electron acceptors are much better substrates for pyranose oxidase than oxygen. The optimum pH of the pyranose oxidase-catalyzed reaction depends strongly on the electron acceptor employed and varies from 4 to 8. It has been proposed that the main metabolic function of pyranose oxidase is as a constituent of the ligninolytic system of white rot fungi that provides peroxidases with H2O2. An additional function could be reduction of quinones, key intermediates that are formed during mineralization of lignin.},

Current hypotheses posit the early divergence of two discrete clades from an ancestral green flagellate. One clade, the Chlorophyta, comprises the early diverging prasinophytes, which gave rise to the core chlorophytes. The other clade, the Streptophyta, includes the charophyte green algae from which the land plants evolved. Multi-marker and genome scale phylogenetic studies have greatly improved our understanding of broad-scale relationships of the green lineage, yet many questions persist, including the branching orders of the prasinophyte lineages, the relationships among core chlorophyte clades (Chlorodendrophyceae, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae), and the relationships among the streptophytes. Current phylogenetic hypotheses provide an evolutionary framework for molecular evolutionary studies and comparative genomics. This review summarizes our current understanding of organelle genome evolution in the green algae, genomic insights into the ecology of oceanic picoplanktonic prasinophytes, molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of complexity in volvocine green algae, and the evolution of genetic codes and the translational apparatus in green seaweeds. Finally, we discuss molecular evolution in the streptophyte lineage, emphasizing the genetic facilitation of land plant origins.},

Despite recent progress in unravelling phylogenetic relationships among major green plant lineages, problematic nodes still remain in the green tree of life. One of the major issues concerns the scaly biflagellate Mesostigma viride, which is either regarded as representing the earliest divergence of the Streptophyta or a separate lineage that diverged before the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. Phylogenies based on chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes support the latter view. Because some green plant lineages are not represented in these phylogenies, sparse taxon sampling has been suspected to yield misleading topologies. Here, we describe the complete chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence of the early-diverging charophycean alga Chlorokybus atmophyticus and present chloroplast genome-based phylogenies with an expanded taxon sampling.},

  abstract = {Background Because they represent the earliest divergences of the Chlorophyta, the morphologically diverse unicellular green algae making up the prasinophytes hold the key to understanding the nature of the first viridiplants and the evolutionary patterns that accompanied the radiation of chlorophytes. Nuclear-encoded 18S rDNA phylogenies unveiled nine prasinophyte clades (clades I through IX) but their branching order is still uncertain. We present here the newly sequenced chloroplast genomes of Nephroselmis astigmatica (clade III) and of five picoplanktonic species from clade VI (Prasinococcus sp. CCMP 1194, Prasinophyceae sp. MBIC 106222 and Prasinoderma coloniale) and clade VII (Picocystis salinarum and Prasinophyceae sp. CCMP 1205). These chloroplast DNAs (cpDNAs) were compared with those of the six previously sampled prasinophytes (clades I, II, III and V) in order to gain information both on the relationships among prasinophyte lineages and on chloroplast genome evolution. Results Varying from 64.3 to 85.6~kb in size and encoding 100 to 115 conserved genes, the cpDNAs of the newly investigated picoplanktonic species are substantially smaller than those observed for larger-size prasinophytes, are economically packed and contain a reduced gene content. Although the Nephroselmis and Picocystis cpDNAs feature a large inverted repeat encoding the rRNA operon, gene partitioning among the single copy regions is remarkably different. Unexpectedly, we found that all three species from clade VI (Prasinococcales) harbor chloroplast genes not previously documented for chlorophytes (ndhJ, rbcR, rpl21, rps15, rps16 and ycf66) and that Picocystis contains a trans-spliced group II intron. The phylogenies inferred from cpDNA-encoded proteins are essentially congruent with 18S rDNA trees, resolving with robust support all six examined prasinophyte lineages, with the exception of the Pycnococcaceae. Conclusions Our results underscore the high variability in genome architecture among prasinophyte lineages, highlighting the strong pressure to maintain a small and compact chloroplast genome in picoplanktonic species. The unique set of six chloroplast genes found in the Prasinococcales supports the ancestral status of this lineage within the prasinophytes. The widely diverging traits uncovered for the clade-VII members (Picocystis and Prasinophyceae sp. CCMP 1205) are consistent with their resolution as separate lineages in the chloroplast phylogeny.},

  abstract = {In plant cells, ascorbate is a major antioxidant that is involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) is the enzymatic component of this cycle involved in the regeneration of reduced ascorbate. The identification of the intron-exon organization and the promoter region of the pea (Pisum sativum) MDAR 1 gene was achieved in pea leaves using the method of walking polymerase chain reaction on genomic DNA. The nuclear gene of MDAR 1 comprises nine exons and eight introns, giving a total length of 3,770 bp. The sequence of 544 bp upstream of the initiation codon, which contains the promoter and 5{${'}$} untranslated region, and 190 bp downstream of the stop codon were also determined. The presence of different regulatory motifs in the promoter region of the gene might indicate distinct responses to various conditions. The expression analysis in different plant organs by northern blots showed that fruits had the highest level of MDAR. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of pea leaves transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens having the binary vectors pGD, which contain the autofluorescent proteins enhanced green fluorescent protein and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein with the full-length cDNA for MDAR 1 and catalase, indicated that the MDAR 1 encoded the peroxisomal isoform. The functional analysis of MDAR by activity and protein expression was studied in pea plants grown under eight stress conditions, including continuous light, high light intensity, continuous dark, mechanical wounding, low and high temperature, cadmium, and the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. This functional analysis is representative of all the MDAR isoforms present in the different cell compartments. Results obtained showed a significant induction by high light intensity and cadmium. On the other hand, expression studies, performed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated differential expression patterns of peroxisomal MDAR 1 transcripts in pea plants grown under the mentioned stress conditions. These findings show that the peroxisomal MDAR 1 has a differential regulation that could be indicative of its specific function in peroxisomes. All these biochemical and molecular data represent a significant step to understand the specific physiological role of each MDAR isoenzyme and its participation in the antioxidant mechanisms of plant cells.},

Here we use a transcriptomic approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with temperature acclimation and adaptation in closely related colderand warmer-adapted diatom species. We find evidence that evolutionary changes in baseline gene expression, which we termed transcriptional investment or divestment, is a key mechanism used by diatoms to adapt to different growth temperatures. Invested and divested pathways indicate that the maintenance of protein processing machinery and membrane structure, important short-term physiological mechanisms used to respond to temperature changes, are key elements associated with adaptation to different growth temperatures. Our results also indicate that evolutionary changes in the transcriptional regulation of acetyl-CoA associated pathways, including lipid and branched chain amino acid metabolism, are used by diatoms to balance photosynthetic light capture and metabolism with changes in growth temperature. Transcriptional investment and divestment can provide a framework to identify mechanisms of acclimation and adaption to temperature.},

T.~pseudonana showed fastest growth rates under long photoperiods and low to moderate light intensities, while the larger T.~punctigera showed fastest growth rates under short photoperiods and higher light intensities. Photosystem II function and content responded primarily to instantaneous growth light intensities during the photoperiod, while diel carbon fixation and RUBISCO content responded more to photoperiod duration than to instantaneous light intensity. Changing photoperiods caused species-specific changes in the responses of photochemical yield (e-/photon) to growth light intensity. These photophysiological variables showed complex responses to photoperiod and to growth light intensity. Growth rate also showed complex responses to photoperiod and growth light intensity. But these complex responses resolved into a close relation between growth rate and the cumulative daily generation of reductant, across the matrix of photoperiods and light intensities.},

  abstract = {Iron deficiency has been considered one of the main limiting factors of phytoplankton productivity in some aquatic systems including oceans and lakes. Concomitantly, solar ultraviolet-B radiation has been shown to have both deleterious and positive impacts on phytoplankton productivity. However, how iron-deficient cyanobacteria respond to UV-B radiation has been largely overlooked in aquatic systems. In this study, physiological responses of four cyanobacterial strains (Microcystis and Synechococcus), which are widely distributed in freshwater or marine systems, were investigated under different UV-B irradiances and iron conditions. The growth, photosynthetic pigment composition, photosynthetic activity, and nonphotochemical quenching of the different cyanobacterial strains were drastically altered by enhanced UV-B radiation under iron-deficient conditions, but were less affected under iron-replete conditions. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron content increased and decreased, respectively, with increased UV-B radiation under iron-deficient conditions for both Microcystis aeruginosa FACHB 912 and Synechococcus sp. WH8102. On the contrary, intracellular ROS and iron content of these two strains remained constant and increased, respectively, with increased UV-B radiation under iron-replete conditions. These results indicate that iron-deficient cyanobacteria are more susceptible to enhanced UV-B radiation. Therefore, UV-B radiation probably plays an important role in influencing primary productivity in iron-deficient aquatic systems, suggesting that its effects on the phytoplankton productivity may be underestimated in iron-deficient regions around the world.},

LeMDAR were integrated into the tomato genome. The MDAR activities and the levels of reduced ascorbate (AsA) were markedly increased in sense transgenic lines and decreased in antisense transgenic lines compared with wild?type (WT) plants. Under low and high temperature stresses, the sense transgenic plants showed lower level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) content, higher net photosynthetic rate (Pn), higher maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and fresh weight compared with WT plants. The oxidizable P700 decreased more obviously in WT and antisense plants than that in sense plants at chilling temperature under low irradiance. Furthermore, the sense transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower H2O2 level, higher ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity, greater Pn and Fv/Fm under methyl viologen (MV)?mediated oxidative stresses. These results indicated that overexpression of chloroplastic MDAR played an important role in alleviating photoinhibition of PSI and PSII and enhancing the tolerance to various abiotic stresses by elevating AsA level.},

Much less clear is the amount of exogenous H2O2 that is sufficient to injure the bacterium and/or to trigger its stress response. To fill this gap, we need to study the behavior of cells when they are exposed to defined amounts of H2O2 on an hours-long time scale. Such experiments are difficult because bacteria rapidly consume H2O2 that is added to test cultures. Further, lab media itself can generate H2O2, and media components interfere with the quantification of H2O2 levels. In this study we describe mechanisms by which media components interfere with H2O2 determinations, and we identify simple ways to minimize and correct for this interference. Using these techniques, it was shown that standard media generate so much H2O2 that most intracellular H2O2 derives from the medium rather than from endogenous metabolism. Indeed, bacteria spread on plates must induce their stress response or else perish. Finally, two straightforward methods were used to sustain low-micromolar steady-state concentrations of H2O2. In this way we determined that {$>$} 2 {$\mu$}M extracellular H2O2 is sufficient to trigger the intracellular OxyR stress response, and {$>$} 5 {$\mu$}M begins to impair cell growth in a minimal medium. These concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than the doses that have typically been used in lab experiments. The new approaches should enable workers to study how various organisms cope with natural levels of H2O2 stress.,},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the most important antibacterial mechanisms of engineered nanoparticles (NPs). To elucidate the ROS generation mechanisms, we investigated the ROS production kinetics of seven selected metal-oxide NPs and their bulk counterparts under UV irradiation (365 nm). The results show that different metal oxides had distinct photogenerated ROS kinetics. Particularly, TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles generated three types of ROS (superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen), whereas other metal oxides generated only one or two types or did not generate any type of ROS. Moreover, NPs yielded more ROS than their bulk counterparts likely due to larger surface areas of NPs providing more absorption sites for UV irradiation. The ROS generation mechanism was elucidated by comparing the electronic structures (i.e., band edge energy levels) of the metal oxides with the redox potentials of various ROS generation, which correctly interpreted the ROS generation of most metal oxides. To develop a quantitative relationship between oxidative stress and antibacterial activity of NPs, we examined the viability of E. coli cells in aqueous suspensions of NPs under UV irradiation, and a linear correlation was found between the average concentration of total ROS and the bacterial survival rates (R2 = 0.84). Although some NPs (i.e., ZnO and CuO nanoparticles) released toxic ions that partially contributed to their antibacterial activity, this correlation quantitatively linked ROS production capability of NPs to their antibacterial activity as well as shed light on the applications of metal-oxide NPs as potential antibacterial agents.},

P. imperforata was found to occur in several coastal environments, but at very low abundances (typically {$<$}50 cells ml-1). The seasonal abundance of P. imperforata examined at one sampling site remained consistently low and constituted no more than 1\% of the total nanoplankton at any time during a 17-month sampling period. In contrast to the low abundances observed in natural water samples, P. imperforata frequently dominated heterotrophic enrichment cultures prepared from these same samples, comprising up to 98\% of the total nanoplankton. Based on these findings, we conclude that P. imperforata is an opportunistic species capable of growing rapidly to high abundances when prey concentrations are high. Water and enrichment temperature as well as the temperature tolerance range of P. imperforata appear to have played a role in the seasonal differences observed in P. imperforata dominance. Experiments with enrichment cultures indicated that the absolute abundances of P. imperforata in the water samples and the activity of consumers of nanoplankton also influenced the degree to which P. imperforata dominated the heterotrophic nanoplankton assemblages of enrichment cultures. Seasonal changes in water temperature might also affect these latter factors, and, as a consequence, indirectly influence the ability of P. imperforata populations to dominate enrichments. Our results support the notion that enrichment cultivation of heterotrophic flagellates, and perhaps incubations in general, can select for species such as P. imperforata that may not be representative of nanoplanktonic protists that numerically dominate natural assemblages.},

  abstract = {The trophic mode of a phototrophic dinoflagellate is a critical factor in the dynamics of its harmful algal bloom. Recent discoveries of the mixotrophic capabilities of phototrophic dinoflagellates have changed the traditional view of bloom dynamics and prediction models. Here, mixotrophy in the harmful phototrophic dinoflagellate Takayama tasmanica was examined. Moreover, growth and ingestion rates of T. tasmanica on each of Alexandrium minutum CCMP1888 and Alexandrium tamarense CCMP1493, suitable prey, were determined as a function of prey concentration. This study reported for the first time that T. tasmanica is a mixotrophic species. Among the phytoplankton species offered as prey, T. tasmanica fed on all prey species whose equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) was greater than 30\,{$\mu$}m, but also A. minutum whose ESD was 19\,{$\mu$}m. In contrast, T. tasmanica did not feed on the phototrophic dinoflagellates Heterocapsa triquetra, Gymnodinium aureolum, Scrippsiella acuminata (previously S. trochoidea), Cochlodinium polykrikoides, Alexandrium affine, Alexandrium insuetum, and Alexandrium pacificum that its sister species Takayama helix is able to feed on. With increasing mean prey concentration, ingestion rates of T. tasmanica on A. minutum increased, but became saturated at the prey concentrations of {$>$}2130 cells mL-1 (1070\,ng\,C\,mL-1). The maximum ingestion rate (MIR) of T. tasmanica on A. minutum was 0.5\,ng\,C predator-1 d-1 (1.0 cells predator-1 d-1) which is only 64\% of the body carbon of a T. tasmanica cell. Growth rates of T. tasmanica on A. minutum were not affected by prey concentrations. Thus, the low maximum ingestion rate is likely to be responsible for the small increases of its growth rate through mixotrophy. In addition, neither growth nor ingestion rates of T. tasmanica feeding on Alexandrium tamarense were affected by prey concentrations. The maximum ingestion rate of T. tasmanica on A. minutum was considerably lower than that of T. helix on the same prey species. Therefore, the mixotrophic ability of T. tasmanica is weaker than that of T. helix, and also T. tasmanica may have an ecological niche different from that of T. helix in marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Nutrient uptake affinity affects the competitive ability of microbial organisms at low nutrient concentrations. From the theory of diffusion limitation it follows that uptake affinity scales linearly with the cell radius. This is in conflict with some observations suggesting that uptake affinity scales to a quantity that is closer to the square of the radius, i.e., to cell surface area. We show that this apparent conflict can be resolved by nutrient uptake theory. Pure diffusion limitation assumes that the cell is a perfect sink which means that it is able to absorb all encountered nutrients instantaneously. Here, we provide empirical evidence that the perfect sink strategy is not common in phytoplankton. Although, small cells are indeed favored by a large surface to volume ratio, we show that they are punished by higher relative investment cost in order to fully benefit from the larger surface to volume ratio. We show that there are two reasons for this. First, because the small cells need a higher transporter density (p) in order to maximize their affinity, and second because the relative cost of a transporter is higher for a small than for a large cell. We suggest, that this might explain why observed uptake affinities do not scale linearly with the cell radius.},

  abstract = {It is generally believed that diseases caused by oxidative stress should be treated with antioxidants. However, clinical trials with such antioxidants as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, failed to produce the expected beneficial results. On the other hand, important biomolecules can be modified by the introduction of oxygen atoms by means of non-oxidative hydroxyl radicals. In addition, hydroxyl radicals can reduce disulfide bonds in proteins, specifically fibrinogen, resulting in their unfolding and scrambled refolding into abnormal spatial configurations. Consequences of this reaction are observed in many diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer and neurological disorders, and can be prevented by the action of non-reducing substances. Moreover, many therapeutic substances, traditionally classified as antioxidants, accept electrons and thus are effective oxidants. It is described in this paper that hydroxyl radicals can be generated by ferric ions without any oxidizing agent. In view of the well-known damaging effect of poorly chelated iron in the human body, numerous natural products containing iron binding agents can be essential in the maintenance of human health. However, beneficial effects of the great number of phytochemicals that are endowed with hydroxyl radical scavenging and/or iron chelating activities should not be considered as a proof for oxidative stress.},

A central challenge to the analysis of this data is sequence alignment, whereby sequence reads must be compared to a reference. A wide variety of alignment algorithms and software have been subsequently developed over the past two years. In this article, we will systematically review the current development of these algorithms and introduce their practical applications on different types of experimental data. We come to the conclusion that short-read alignment is no longer the bottleneck of data analyses. We also consider future development of alignment algorithms with respect to emerging long sequence reads and the prospect of cloud computing.},

Thus, the balance of an aquatic ecosystem may be destroyed. In this study, Karenia brevis and Skeletonema costatum were exposed to nano-TiO2 (anatase, average particle size of 5\textendash 10nm, specific surface area of 210{$\pm$}10m2g-1) to assess the effects of nano-TiO2 on algae. The findings of transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrate aggregation of nano-TiO2 in the algal suspension. Nano-TiO2 was also found to be inside algal cells. The growth of the two species of algae was inhibited under nano-TiO2 exposure. The 72h EC50 values of nano-TiO2 to K. brevis and S. costatum were 10.69 and 7.37mgL-1, respectively. TEM showed that the cell membrane of K. brevis was destroyed and its organelles were almost undistinguished under nano-TiO2 exposure. The malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of K. brevis and S. costatum significantly increased compared with those of the control (p{$<$}0.05). Meanwhile, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities (CAT) of K. brevis and S. costatum changed in different ways. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in both species were significantly higher than those of the control (p{$<$}0.05). The site of ROS production and accumulation in K. brevis and S. costatum under nano-TiO2 exposure was explored with the addition of inhibitors of different electron transfer chains. This study indicated that nano-TiO2 in algal suspensions inhibited the growth of K. brevis and S. costatum. This effect was attributed to oxidative stress caused by ROS production inside algal cells. The levels of anti-oxidative enzymes changed, which destroyed the balance between oxidation and anti-oxidation. Thus, algae were damaged by ROS accumulation, resulting in lipid oxidation and inhibited algae growth. The inhibitors of the electron transfer chain showed that the site of ROS production and accumulation in K. brevis cells was the chloroplast.},

Organic carbon sources decreased the cell photosynthetic pigment content and chlorophyll a to c ratio, but with a higher carotenoid to chlorophyll a ratio. Ratios of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and 77~K fluorescence spectra of mixotrophic cells indicated a reduced photochemical efficiency of photosystem II. The results were accompanied by lower electron transport rate. Therefore, organic carbon sources reduced the photosynthesis efficiency, and the enhancement of biomass of P. tricornutum implied that organic carbon sources had more pronounced effects on respiration than on photosynthesis.},

The results showed that low nitrogen condition caused significant decrease in chlorophyll a content and photosynthesis efficiency, and thereby inhibition of algal growth. Additionally, the soluble protein decreased at low nitrogen concentration, while the intracellular reactive oxygen species of all treatments increased largely in the stationary phase compared to the exponential phase. The main carbon resource may flow to synthesize TAG when proteins synthesis inhibition occurred. The pigment reduction and low growth rate contributed to TAG accumulation. However, the falling photosynthesis would slow down the rate of TAG formation, or even induce degradation of neutral lipid droplet. The accumulation of TAG seems to be a protective mechanism to help algal cells survive under nitrogen-limited stress.},

The findings show that productivity can be trebled under mixotrophic conditions (from 0.2 g\$\textbackslash cdot\$L-1\$\textbackslash cdot\$d-1 to 0.66 g\$\textbackslash cdot\$L-1\$\textbackslash cdot\$d-1) with the addition of sodium acetate. The results also indicate that both the growth rate and final yield increase with the cultivation temperature, with most parameters showing an optimum in the range of 30\textendash 35 \textdegree C. The maximum specific growth rate was found to be in the region of 0.12 h-1 at a surface irradiance between 100\textendash 500 \$\textbackslash mathrm\textbackslash mu\$E\$\textbackslash cdot\$m-2\$\textbackslash cdot\$s-1. This high growth rate makes the strain particularly suited to the rapid production of biomass, suitable for either whole cell bioprocessing or bioremediation. However, the relatively low lipid productivity (9.2 mg\$\textbackslash cdot\$L-1\$\textbackslash cdot\$d-1) confirms previous findings which would indicate poor applicability for biodiesel production. The strain shows greater promise in wastewater treatment applications with removal rates of nitrogen and phosphorus in the region of 37 and 30 mg\$\textbackslash cdot\$L-1\$\textbackslash cdot\$d-1 respectively. Furthermore, the findings show that a fed-batch strategy to inorganic nutrient loading can increase the final yield by around 50\% compared to a conventional batch run. This is particularly interesting as fed-batch production techniques are rarely used within microalgal cultivation, so provide an interesting avenue for further investigation. Overall, the findings show that C. sorokiniana UTEX 1230 is a robust and fast-growing microalgal strain suitable both for the laboratory and scale-up.},

Mannitol oxidase was previously investigated in terrestrial snails and slugs, being also present in a few aquatic gastropods. However, the overall distribution of this enzyme in the Gastropoda was not known. Polyol dehydrogenases are also poorly studied in gastropods and other mollusks. In this study, polyalcohol oxidase and dehydrogenase activities were assayed in the digestive gland of 26 species of gastropods, representing the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha, Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia. Marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, including herbivores and carnivores were analyzed. Ultrastructural observations were undertake in species possessing mannitol oxidase, in order to investigate the correlation between this enzyme and the presence of tubular structures known to be associated with it. Mannitol oxidase activity was detected in the digestive gland of herbivores from the clades Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia, but not in any carnivores or in herbivores from the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha and Vetigastropoda. In most of the species used in this study, dehydrogenase activities were detected using both D-mannitol and D-sorbitol as substrates. Nevertheless, in some carnivores these activities were not detected with both polyalcohols. Ultrastructural observations revealed tubular structures in digestive gland cells of some species having mannitol oxidase activity, but they were not observed in others. Based on our results, we suggest that mannitol oxidase first occurred in a herbivorous or omnivorous ancestor of Apogastropoda, the clade formed by caenogastropods and heterobranchs, being subsequently lost in those species that shifted towards a carnivorous diet.},

  abstract = {Oxyrrhis marina is an extensively studied morphospecies and a common protist model used to examine a range of ecological processes. Further, as a result of a number of unusual cytological and genetic features, Oxyrrhis is increasingly a target for the study of evolutionary patterns and genome organization within the Alveolata. However, a small number of early morphological studies and recent phylogenetic data suggest that O. marina represents more than one species. As different research groups employ different O. marina isolates (which are potentially highly divergent strains or different species), the context in which comparisons between isolates can be made is difficult to assess. In this paper, we explore the literature that has contributed to the definition of O. marina, highlighting the unusual characteristics possessed by O. marina that have motivated much of the study on this organism and informed its key phylogenetic position. In addition, we assess historical and contemporary evidence for multiple Oxyrrhis species. Based on this assessment, in particular recent molecular genetic data, we assert that O. marina represents two species: O. marina and O. maritima. Based on historical observations, we also indicate that a third species (O. tenticulifera) may occur, although there are no contemporary data to support or refute this designation. Extensive cryptic diversity has important implications for researchers studying Oxyrrhis: caution must be exercised in characterizing Oxyrrhis isolates for experimental study (i.e. it is inappropriate to report assessments concerning poorly characterized isolates), and comparative studies of multiple isolates are required to assess individual, population and species level variation in the genus. Finally, in a broader context, the ecological and evolutionary processes driving diversity in free-living protists remains poorly understood. Model protists such as O. marina and O. maritima for which we are beginning to recognize and characterize an extensive pool of variation present ideal opportunities to unravel these fundamental processes.},

Water managers are considering how to implement monitoring that leads to a minimization of the risks incurred by the users of potentially contaminated sites. To address this question, this study involved assessing the performance of a submersible probe for measuring phycocyanin-specific fluorescence as a function of cyanobacterial biomass, with the aim of applying it as a tool for surveillance management. Its advantages and limits compared to more traditional analyses are discussed. The monitoring of cyanobacteria in the water bodies of western France was carried out using a minifluorimeter specific to the fluorescence of phycocyanin, a pigment specific to cyanobacteria. The results are compared with the analyses recommended by the World Health Organisation (chlorophyll a and cell counting). This study based on nearly 800 samples shows a significant correlation between the phycocyanin content and the cyanobacterial biomass, expressed as the number of cells per mL (R2 = 0.73). This submersible probe is simple and rapid to use, making it possible to take into account horizontal and vertical heterogeneities in the proliferation growth. In this way, we are able to detect at an early stage the conditions that could potentially lead to a risk, in order to start sampling. Due to its sensitivity, this tool proves suitable for monitoring aimed at reducing the risks incurred by the users of contaminated sites and launching preventative actions. The use of the phycocyanin probe provides an effective tool to complement traditional analyses of cyanobacterial presence. It is suggested that a surveillance protocol based on phycocyanin concentration can significantly improved the accuracy of the extent of cyanobacterial bloom development in the light of spatial and temporal variabilities associated with these occurrences.},

It causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA and is implicated in cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders and aging. As protection, cells express soluble superoxide dismutases, disproportionating superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Here, we describe a membrane-bound enzyme that directly oxidizes superoxide and funnels the sequestered electrons to ubiquinone in a diffusion-limited reaction. Experiments in proteoliposomes and inverted membranes show that the protein is capable of efficiently quenching superoxide generated at the membrane in vitro. The 2.0\,\AA{} crystal structure shows an integral membrane di-heme cytochrome b poised for electron transfer from the P-side and proton uptake from the N-side. This suggests that the reaction is electrogenic and contributes to the membrane potential while also conserving energy by reducing the quinone pool. Based on this enzymatic activity, we propose that the enzyme family be denoted superoxide oxidase (SOO).},

Fragilariopsis nana differs from F. cylindrus in having a smaller valve width, a higher poroid density in the striae eschweizerbartxxx and a tendency to have more rows of poroids. Both species are found in polar and subpolar regions in the Arctic and in the Antarctic and in open water as well as in ice. No morphological differences were detected between the species from the two hemispheres and we therefore cannot reject that the two species are actually bipolar. Unfortunately the cultures used in the phylogenetic analyses appeared to be Arctic F. cylindrus and Antarctic F. nana. The phylogenetic analyses supported the morphological studies but could not be used to support or reject the hypothesis about bipolarity.},

  abstract = {In order to elucidate the phylogeny and evolutionary history of the Bacillariaceae we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 42 species (sequences were determined from more than two strains of many of the Pseudo-nitzschia species) based on the first 872 base pairs of nuclear-encoded large subunit (LSU) rDNA, which include some of the most variable domains. Four araphid genera were used as the outgroup in maximum likelihood, parsimony and distance analyses. The phylogenetic inferences revealed the Bacillariaceae as monophyletic (bootstrap support 90 \%). A clade comprising Pseudo-nitzschia, Fragilariopsis and Nitzschia americana (clade A) was supported by high bootstrap values ( 94 \%) and agreed with the morphological features revealed by electron microscopy. Data for 29 taxa indicate a subdivision of clade A, one clade comprising Pseudo-nitzschia species, a second clade consisting of Pseudo-nitzschia species and Nitzschia americana, and a third clade comprising Fragilariopsis species. Pseudo-nitzschia as presently defined is paraphyletic and emendation of the genus is probably needed. The analyses suggested that Nitzschia is not monophyletic, as expected from the great morphological diversity within the genus. A cluster characterized by possession of detailed ornamentation on the frustule is indicated. Eighteen taxa (16 within the Bacillariaceae) were tested for production of domoic acid, a neurotoxic amino acid. Only P. australis, P. multiseries and P. seriata produced domoic acid, and these clustered together in all analyses. Since Nitzschia navis-varingica also produces domoic acid, but is distantly related to the cluster comprising the Pseudo-nitzschia domoic acid producers, it is most parsimonious to suggest that the ability of species in the Bacillariaceae to produce domoic acid has evolved at least twice.},

In this study, using in vivo biochemical markers and whole-cell iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis, we explored the cellular responses associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell fate decision during the early response to Fe limitation in the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. Fe limitation caused a significant decrease in Photosystem (PS) II photosynthetic efficiency, damage to the photosynthetic electron transport chain in PS I, and blockage of the respiratory chain in complexes III and IV, which could all result in excess ROS accumulation. The increase in ROS likely triggered programmed cell death (PCD) in some of the Fe-limited cells through synthesis of a series of proteins involved in the delicate balance between pro-survival and pro-PCD factors. The results provide molecular-level insights into the major strategies that may be employed by T. pseudonana in response to Fe-limitation: the reduction of cell population density through PCD to reduce competition for available Fe, the reallocation of intracellular nitrogen and Fe to ensure survival, and an increase in expression of antioxidant and anti-PCD proteins to cope with stress.},

Generally, anatase is more active than rutile, but no consensus exists to explain this difference. Here we demonstrate that it is the bulk transport of excitons to the surface that contributes to the difference. Utilizing high \textendash quality epitaxial TiO2 films of the two polymorphs we evaluate the photocatalytic activity as a function of TiO2-film thickness. For anatase the activity increases for films up to \textasciitilde 5\hspace{0.25em}nm thick, while rutile films reach their maximum activity for \textasciitilde 2.5\hspace{0.25em}nm films already. This shows that charge carriers excited deeper in the bulk contribute to surface reactions in anatase than in rutile. Furthermore, we measure surface orientation dependent activity on rutile single crystals. The pronounced orientation-dependent activity can also be correlated to anisotropic bulk charge carrier mobility, suggesting general importance of bulk charge diffusion for explaining photocatalytic anisotropies.},

The method utilizes flow cytometric measurements of HyPer fluorescence in H2O2-exposed cells to analyze the biosensor oxidation kinetics. Fitting the experimental curves with kinetic equations allows determining the rate constants of HyPer oxidation/reduction which are used further for the calculation of peroxide concentrations in the cells of interest both in the presence and absence of external H2O2. Applying this method to K562\,cells, we have estimated the gradient as about 390-fold between the extracellular and intracellular level of exogenous H2O2 in cells exposed to the micromole doses of peroxide, as well as the average basal level of H2O2 in the cytosol of undisturbed cells ([H2O2]basal=2.2{$\pm$}0.4nM). The method can be extended to other H2O2-sensitive redox probes or to procedures in which, rather than adding external peroxide, intracellular production of peroxide is triggered, providing a tool to quantitate not only basal average H2O2 concentrations but also the concentration of peroxide build up in the vicinity of redox probes.},

The three species differed in the sensitivity of Rubisco activity in crude extracts to magnesium ion concentration, the presence of protease inhibitors, the duration of the incubation on activity, and the potential for full activation of Rubisco with 20 mM magnesium chloride and 20 mM bicarbonate t in vitro. t D. tertiolecta had responses that were similar to those described in vascular plants: regulation of initial activity on a gradient of irradiances; maximum initial activities that were 80\textendash{} 90\% of light-saturated photosynthesis; total activities that exceeded light-saturated photosynthesis by 30\textendash 100\%; and deactivation of Rubisco in darkness. Both initial and total activity declined in darkness and increased on a return to growth irradiance. First-order time constants were about 9 min for deactivation and 3 min for reactivation of initial activity. The decline in total activity after a transition into darkness could not be reversed t in vitro but could be reversed by exposing t D. tertiolecta to light, a characteristic of regulation by CA1P. The responses of t T. pseudonana were qualitatively similar, except that recovery of initial activity was low and could only account for 30\textendash 40\% of light-saturated photosynthesis. Rubisco from t T. pseudonana exposed to low irradiance could be activated t in vitro but at growth irradiance and higher, total activity was lower than initial activity. The time constants for deactivation and reactivation of initial activity after reciprocal switches between growth irradiance and darkness were 12\textendash 18 min and 3 min in t T. pseudonana. t P. lutheri showed no regulation of Rubisco activity in response to changes in irradiance or light-dark transitions.

Their photosynthetic responses were characterized by low specific absorption, low light-limited and light-saturated rates of photosynthesis, and high quantum yields, indicative of acclimation to low irradiance and internal self-shading. High fucoxanthin: Chi ratios also indicated low light acclimation, but high photoprotective xanthophyll: Chi ratios suggested a high capacity for photoprotective energy dissipation. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) could be activated and deactivated in response to changes in irradiance and was fully activated at the surface of the water column and fully deactivated in aphotic deep water. Maximum Rubisco activity was correlated with Rubisco content and bulk protein content of the phytoplankton and with light-saturated rates of photosynthesis measured in short ({$<$} 20-min) incubations. Long (60-min) incubations caused a decrease in the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis, possibly because of feedback limitation. While feedback limitation is unlikely to occur in the water column, it should be considered when estimating productivity in well-mixed waters from fixed light-depth incubations.},

Temperature is also a major influence on Prochlorococcus abundance and distribution in the ocean, and studies in other photosynthetic organisms have shown that HOOH and temperature extremes can act together as synergistic stressors. To address potential synergistic effects of temperature and HOOH on Prochlorococcus growth, high- and low-temperature-adapted representative strains were cultured at ecologically relevant concentrations under a range of HOOH concentrations and temperatures. Higher concentrations of HOOH severely diminished the permissive temperature range for growth of both Prochlorococcus strains. At the permissive temperatures, the growth rates of both Prochlorococcus strains decreased as a function of HOOH, and cold temperature increased susceptibility of photosystem II to HOOH-mediated damage. Serving as a proxy for the natural community, co-cultured heterotrophic bacteria increased the Prochlorococcus growth rate under these temperatures, and expanded the permissive range of temperature for growth. These studies indicate that in the ocean, the cross-protective function of the microbial community may confer a fitness increase for Prochlorococcus at its temperature extremes, especially near the ocean surface where oxidative stress is highest. This interaction may play a substantial role in defining the realized thermal niche and habitat range of Prochlorococcus with respect to latitude.},

Here, we have purified and characterized an APX from the soluble fraction of plastids of non-photosynthetic tobacco BY-2 cells. The plastidic APX was a monomer with a molecular weight of 34 000. The enzymatic properties of the plastidic APX, including the rapid inactivation by H2O2 in ascorbate-depleted medium, were highly comparable with those of the chloroplastic stromal APX of spinach and tea leaves. However, the other chloroplastic APX isoenzyme, the thylakoid-membrane bound APX, was not detected in the plastids of the BY-2 cells. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the plastidic APX was completely identical with the deduced amino acid sequence of a previously identified cDNA sequence of tobacco chloroplastic APX. When a green fluorescence protein gene tagged with the chloroplast-targeting signal sequence of APX was expressed in the BY-2 cells, the fluorescence protein exclusively localized into plastids, and not into mitochondria. We conclude that plastidic APX in non-photosynthetic tissues is the same as the chloroplastic APX that occurs in leaves.},

These four diatoms are characterized by distinct size, shape and colony forming ability and are important components of the autumnal bloom co-occurring with the seasonal peak of T. stylifera abundance in Mediterranean coastal waters. High-speed video recordings showed that T. stylifera acquired cells in a suspension feeding mode while creating feeding currents. Copepod behavior was quantified in terms of feeding, motion, and grooming activities. T. stylifera spent more time in hovering than cruising in presence of all diets. The solitary L. aporus and P. calliantha elicited longer feeding bouts, lower appendage beat frequency and shorter grooming events compared to the colonial L. danicus and C. socialis. Overall the present results indicate that the behavioral responses of T. stylifera to different diatom diets were species-specific. The observed behavioral plasticity may help T. stylifera to adjust rapidly to changes in the food environment and this can be advantageous in exploiting short-lived phytoplankton blooms.},

  abstract = {New antibacterial strategies are required in view of the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. One promising technique involves the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. Upon exposure to light, a photosensitizer in bacteria can generate singlet oxygen, which oxidizes proteins or lipids, leading to bacteria death. To elucidate the oxidative processes that occur during killing of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was incubated with a standard photosensitizer, and the generation and decay of singlet oxygen was detected directly by its luminescence at 1,270 nm. At low bacterial concentrations, the time-resolved luminescence of singlet oxygen showed a decay time of 6 {$\pm$} 2 {$\mu$}s, which is an intermediate time for singlet oxygen decay in phospholipids of membranes (14 {$\pm$} 2 {$\mu$}s) and in the surrounding water (3.5 {$\pm$} 0.5 {$\mu$}s). Obviously, at low bacterial concentrations, singlet oxygen had sufficient access to water outside of S. aureus by diffusion. Thus, singlet oxygen seems to be generated in the outer cell wall areas or in adjacent cytoplasmic membranes of S. aureus. In addition, the detection of singlet oxygen luminescence can be used as a sensor of intracellular oxygen concentration. When singlet oxygen luminescence was measured at higher bacterial concentrations, the decay time increased significantly, up to {$\approx$}40 {$\mu$}s, because of oxygen depletion at these concentrations. This observation is an important indicator that oxygen supply is a crucial factor in the efficacy of photodynamic inactivation of bacteria, and will be of particular significance should this approach be used against multiresistant bacteria.},

  abstract = {The systematics of single-celled cyanobacteria represents a major challenge due to morphological convergence and application of various taxonomic concepts. The genus Cyanothece is one of the most problematic cases, as the name has been applied to oval-shaped coccoid cyanobacteria lacking sheaths with little regard to their phylogenetic position and details of morphology and ultrastructure. Hereby we analyze an extensive set of complementary genetic and phenotypic evidence to disentangle the relationships among these cyanobacteria. We provide diagnostic characters to separate the known genera Cyanothece, Gloeothece, and Aphanothece, and provide a valid description for Crocosphaera gen. nov. We describe two new genera, Rippkaea and Zehria, to characterize two distinct phylogenetic lineages outside the previously known genera. We further describe 13 new species in total including Cyanothece svehlovae, Gloeothece aequatorialis, G. aurea, G. bryophila, G. citriformis, G. reniformis, Gloeothece tonkinensis, G. verrucosa, Crocosphaera watsonii, C. subtropica, C. chwakensis, Rippkaea orientalis, and Zehria floridana to recognize the intrageneric diversity as rendered by polyphasic analysis. We discuss the close relationship of free-living cyanobacteria from the Crocosphaera lineage to nitrogen-fixing endosymbionts of marine algae. The current study includes several experimental strains (Crocosphaera and ``Cyanothece'') important for the study of diazotrophy and the global oceanic nitrogen cycle, and provides evidence suggesting ancestral N2-fixing capability in the chroococcalean lineage.},

Its members are not animals (which develop from a blastula), plants (which develop from maternally retained plant embryos), or fungi (which lack undulipodia and develop from fungal spores). Protoctist cells contain microtubules, nuclei, and other characteristically eukaryotic features. Many photosynthesize (have plastids), and most are aerobes (have mitochondria). Most have undulipodia with their kinetosome bases at some stage of the life history. All protoctists evolved from symbioses between at least two different kinds of bacteria\textemdash often many more than two. As the symbionts integrated, new levels of individuality appeared. This chapter begins with the presentation of modes I-IV for each Protoctist phylum. Animals and plants belong to mode IV since they display meiotic sexual cycles and are capable of formation of undulipodia (animal somatic, including sensory, cilia and most animal and plant sperm). Since members of the Kingdom Fungi are, by definition, amastigote they belong to mode II: Lack undulipodia but have meiotic cycles.},

Plant NADPH oxidases, also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOHs), are the most thoroughly studied enzymatic ROS-generating systems and our understanding of their involvement in various plant processes has increased considerably in recent years. In this review we discuss their roles as ROS producers during cell growth, plant development and plant response to abiotic environmental constraints and biotic interactions, both pathogenic and symbiotic. This broad range of functions suggests that RBOHs may serve as important molecular `hubs' during ROS-mediated signalling in plants.},

Ichthyotoxic raphidophyte species of Chattonella were found to produce the highest environmental levels of superoxide (177\texttimes 104 total chemiluminescence units). However, ichthyotoxic dinoflagellates (Karenia, Alexandrium) and the prymnesiophyte Prymnesium were also found to produce significant levels of superoxide (4\texttimes 104, 3\texttimes 104 and 5\texttimes 104 chemiluminescence units, respectively), equivalent to that of other raphidophyte species of Heterosigma and Fibrocapsa (6\texttimes 104 and 2\texttimes 104, respectively). A direct relationship between cell size and superoxide production was observed (r2=0.94), with larger cells producing more superoxide per cell. Chattonella produced the most superoxide per cell (expressed as cellular chemiluminescence units), followed by the dinoflagellate species Karenia, Alexandrium, Takayama and Gymnodinium. Small cells, such as the raphidophyte Heterosigma and the prymnesiophyte Prymnesium produced very little superoxide per cell (cellular chemiluminescence units), but potentially could still produce high total levels of superoxide if present at high biomass levels. Species commonly used as aquaculture bivalve feeds such as Dunaliella, Tetraselmis, Nannochloropsis and Pavlova produced negligible levels of superoxide, even at high biomass. We speculate that superoxide, while not the sole ichthyotoxic principle, may play a wider role in algal toxicity than previously considered, and propose a broad classification of microalgae based upon superoxide production.},

Basin-scale ocean dynamic processes such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation connect the physical, climate-related variability to changes in phytoplankton distribution and amount. Thus, improving the reliability of forecasts of large-scale ocean dynamics may help to improve predictions of changes in ocean community ecology.

This relationship is revealed in \textasciitilde 20 years of satellite observations of chlorophyll and sea surface temperature. Interaction between the main pycnocline and the upper ocean seasonal mixed layer is one mechanism behind this correlation.

Depth-generalist corals, those that occupy both of these two distinct ecosystems, are adapted to cope with such extremely diverse conditions. In this study, we investigated the trophic strategy of the depth-generalist hermatypic coral Stylophora pistillata and the ability of mesophotic colonies to adapt to shallow reefs. We compared symbiont genera composition, photosynthetic traits and the holobiont trophic position and carbon sources, calculated from amino acids compound-specific stable isotope analysis (AA-CSIA), of shallow, mesophotic and translocated corals. This species harbors different Symbiodiniaceae genera at the two depths: Cladocopium goreaui (dominant in mesophotic colonies) and Symbiodinium microadriaticum (dominant in shallow colonies) with a limited change after transplantation. This allowed us to determine which traits stem from hosting different symbiont species compositions across the depth gradient. Calculation of holobiont trophic position based on amino acid {$\delta$}15N revealed that heterotrophy represents the same portion of the total energy budget in both depths, in contrast to the dogma that predation is higher in corals growing in low light conditions. Photosynthesis is the major carbon source to corals growing at both depths, but the photosynthetic rate is higher in the shallow reef corals, implicating both higher energy consumption and higher predation rate in the shallow habitat. In the corals transplanted from deep to shallow reef, we observed extensive photo-acclimation by the Symbiodiniaceae cells, including substantial cellular morphological modifications, increased cellular chlorophyll a, lower antennae to photosystems ratios and carbon signature similar to the local shallow colonies. In contrast, non-photochemical quenching remains low and does not increase to cope with the high light regime of the shallow reef. Furthermore, host acclimation is much slower in these deep-to-shallow transplanted corals as evident from the lower trophic position and tissue density compared to the shallow-water corals, even after long-term transplantation (18 months). Our results suggest that while mesophotic reefs could serve as a potential refuge for shallow corals, the transition is complex, as even after a year and a half the acclimation is only partial.},

In addition, molecular tools, such as genetic transformation, have been developed for both species. Despite these molecular advances, relatively little is known regarding the genetic diversity of the available strains of these diatoms. In this study, we have compiled a historical summary of the known P. tricornutum species resources and have provided a genetic and phenotypic overview of 10 different axenic strains. Examination of intraspecies genetic diversity based on internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses indicate four different genotypes. Seven strains are predominantly fusiform, whereas one strain is predominantly oval, and another is predominantly triradiate. Another is defined as a tropical strain because it appears better acclimated to growth at higher temperatures. Observations in the natural environment indicate that P. tricornutum is a coastal marine diatom that is able to adapt to unstable environments, such as estuaries and rock pools. Because it has rarely been noted in nature, we have developed specific primers to amplify ITS2 sequences and have successfully identified it in environmental samples. These resources should become useful tools for the diatom community when combined with the whole genome sequence and will open up a range of new possibilities for experimental investigations that can exploit the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics described.},

Here we provide substantial biochemical evidence that the heme enzyme Ccp1 (cytochrome c peroxidase), which is targeted to the intermembrane space, functions primarily as a mitochondrial H2O2 sensing and signaling protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Key evidence for a sensing role for Ccp1 is the significantly higher H2O2 accumulation in ccp1-null cells(ccp1{$\Delta$}) vs ccp1(W191F) cells producing the catalytically inactive Ccp1(W191F) variant. In fact, intracellular H2O2 levels (ccp1{$\Delta>$}wildtype {$>$}ccp1(W191F)) correlate inversely with the activity of the mitochondrial (and peroxisomal) heme catalase, Cta1 (ccp1{$\Delta$}ccp1(W191F)) and ccp1{$\Delta$} cells exhibit low superoxide levels. Notably, Ccp1(W191F) is a more persistent H2O2 signaling protein than wild-type Ccp1, and this enhanced mitochondrial H2O2 signaling decreases the mitochondrial fitness of ccp1(W191F) cells. However, these cells are fully protected from a bolus (0.4mM) of exogenous H2O2 added after 12h of growth, whereas the viability of ccp1{$\Delta$} cells drops below 20\%, which additionally associates Ccp1 with Yap1-dependent H2O2 signaling. Combined, our results strongly implicate Ccp1, independent of its peroxidase activity, in mitochondrial H2O2 sensing and signaling to maintain reactive oxygen species homeostasis.},

This paper focuses on how the evolution of dependency transforms interactions and the community. Using agent-based modeling we suggest that species specializing in the consumption of a common good escape competition and therefore favor coexistence. This evolutionary trajectory could open the way for novel long-lasting interactions and a need to revisit the classically accepted assembly rules. Such evolutionary events also reshape the structure and dynamics of communities, depending on the spatial heterogeneity of the common good production. Let Black be the new black!},

Here we show that DAO, fused to a genetically encoded H2O2 indicator HyPer, can be used for controlled production of ROS in living eukaryotic cells. We found a clear heterogeneity in ROS production dynamics between individual cells. Moreover, different cell lines demonstrated distinct sensitivity to added D-Ala. Finally, by comparing signals generated by the HyPer-DAO fusion protein versus coexpressed HyPer and DAO proteins, we show that the fusion system is more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide production. Our results show the utility of the HyPer-DAO genetically encoded system for redox signaling studies and suggest that H2O2 produced by DAO in the cytoplasm acts locally in close proximity to the enzyme.

In this study, the morphology and the 18S rDNA sequence of JPCC DA0580 were compared with those of other Fistulifera strains. JPCC DA0580 possesses morphological characters of the genus Fistulifera, namely lightly silicified frustules, a distinct median costa (raphe sternum), and a wart-like central pore (fistula). Morphometric analysis revealed that JPCC DA0580 differs from other Fistulifera species by the presence of a valve with coarser striation and coarser areolation. On the basis of 18S rDNA phylogeny, JPCC DA0580 formed a well-supported clade with other members of the Fistulifera species complex, although the number of nucleotide substitutions was highest in JPCC DA0580.

The Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) software was used to produce a gridded dataset for the time period 1960\textendash 2011. High oxygen concentrations for the upper and bottom layers, separated by an oxygen minimum zone at intermediate layers, are a typical structure of the dissolved oxygen in the Eastern and the Western Mediterranean sub-basins. Although an oxygen minimum zone is observed in both sub-basins, its vertical positions are different; in the Eastern Mediterranean at between 600 and 1200 m depth and in the Western Mediterranean at between 400 and 600~m. The vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen shows significant differences between the two sub-basins and their temporal evolution reveals large interannual to decadal variability. A negative correlation was observed between dissolved oxygen and surface potential temperature due to solubility changes over the whole period. However, the positive correlation between the dissolved oxygen and potential temperature in the Eastern Mediterranean deep layers is an indication that the dynamical processes are dominant and are involved in the dissolved oxygen interannual variability. The dissolved oxygen variability presents shifts with a multi-decadal signal, rather than trends as observed in the global ocean, associated with mixing processes and decadal oscillations that influence the dense water formation or biological activity.},

Throughout the last few billion years, they have played a major role in shaping the Earth as the planet we live in, and they continue to play a significant role in our everyday lives. Besides being an essential source of atmospheric oxygen, marine cyanobacteria are prolific secondary metabolite producers, often despite the exceptionally small genomes. Secondary metabolites produced by these organisms are diverse and complex; these include compounds, such as pigments and fluorescent dyes, as well as biologically-active compounds with a particular interest for the pharmaceutical industry. Cyanobacteria are currently regarded as an important source of nutrients and biofuels and form an integral part of novel innovative energy-efficient designs. Being autotrophic organisms, cyanobacteria are well suited for large-scale biotechnological applications due to the low requirements for organic nutrients. Recent advances in molecular biology techniques have considerably enhanced the potential for industries to optimize the production of cyanobacteria secondary metabolites with desired functions. This manuscript reviews the environmental role of marine cyanobacteria with a particular focus on their secondary metabolites and discusses current and future developments in both the production of desired cyanobacterial metabolites and their potential uses in future innovative projects.},

  abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

  abstract = {The mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) and the plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) are two similar members of the membrane-bound diiron carboxylate group of proteins. AOX is a ubiquinol oxidase present in all higher plants, as well as some algae, fungi, and protists. It may serve to dampen reactive oxygen species generation by the respiratory electron transport chain. PTOX is a plastoquinol oxidase in plants and some algae. It is required in carotenoid biosynthesis and may represent the elusive oxidase in chlororespiration. Recently, prokaryotic orthologues of both AOX and PTOX proteins have appeared in sequence databases. These include PTOX orthologues present in four different cyanobacteria as well as an AOX orthologue in an alpha-proteobacterium. We used PCR, RT-PCR and northern analyses to confirm the presence and expression of the PTOX gene in Anabaena variabilis PCC 7120. An extensive phylogeny of newly found prokaryotic and eukaryotic AOX and PTOX proteins supports the idea that AOX and PTOX represent two distinct groups of proteins that diverged prior to the endosymbiotic events that gave rise to the eukaryotic organelles. Using multiple sequence alignment, we identified residues conserved in all AOX and PTOX proteins. We also provide a scheme to readily distinguish PTOX from AOX proteins based upon differences in amino acid sequence in motifs around the conserved iron-binding residues. Given the presence of PTOX in cyanobacteria, we suggest that this acronym now stand for plastoquinol terminal oxidase. Our results have implications for the photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism of these prokaryotes, as well as for the origin and evolution of eukaryotic AOX and PTOX proteins.},

  abstract = {The pelagic ocean receives terrigenous inputs of a range of organic compounds; however, the role that this terrigenous material plays in the ocean carbon cycle and biological pump is not entirely understood, and questions remain as to how oceanic cycles of terrigenous and autochthonous carbon interact. A significant portion of organic carbon that cannot be utilized by marine microbes in the epipelagic ocean escapes microbial remineralization to be sequestered in the deep ocean as refractory dissolved organic matter (DOM). Lignin, a ``model'' terrigenous compound, is thought to be refractory in the open ocean unless chemically altered. However, in this study, incubation experiments performed using lignin-amended oligotrophic seawater from the Sargasso Sea exhibited bacteria and archaea growth that doubled compared to unamended control treatments. The increase in bacteria and archaea cell abundance in lignin-amended treatments coincided with a 21\textendash 25\% decrease in absorbance (250\textendash 400 nm) of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suggesting that certain microbes may be capable of altering fractions of this ostensibly recalcitrant organic matter. Furthermore, the microbial response to the lignin-amended treatments appears to be taxon-specific. Two phyla of Archaea, Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota, exhibited an increase in abundance of 7-fold and 28-fold (from 2.42 \texttimes{} 106 cells L\textendash 1 to 1.72 \texttimes{} 107 cells L\textendash 1, and from 1.60 \texttimes{} 106 cells L\textendash 1 to 4.54 \texttimes{} 107 cells L\textendash 1, respectively), over 4 days of incubation in lignin-amended treatments. Additionally, an increase of 11-fold and 13-fold (from 2.93 \texttimes{} 106 cells L\textendash 1 to 3.30 \texttimes{} 107 cells L\textendash 1, and from 3.26 \texttimes{} 106 cells L\textendash 1 to 4.28 \texttimes{} 107 cells L\textendash 1, respectively), was observed in the abundance of these phyla in treatments containing lignin with added nitrogen and phosphorus, thus raising questions regarding primary and/or secondary responses to lignin degradation. Our findings indicate that marine bacteria and archaea play a role in the transformation of the optical properties of lignin in the open ocean and that they may serve as a potential sink for a portion of the lignin macromolecule.},

  abstract = {Through in situ holographic imaging of undisturbed water, diatom colonies with high aspect ratios have been found to exhibit preferential horizontal orientation within high biomass subsurface layers. We analyzed holographic video to determine the abundance, size, and orientation of colonies over several vertical profiles from the surface to \textasciitilde 25 m depth. A geometric optics model based on these measurements was then used to estimate light absorption by phytoplankton throughout the water column. Results show a substantial increase in absorption of downwelling irradiance (up to 24.5\%) for horizontally oriented colonies when compared to randomized orientations. The effect can be attributed to maximization of the projected area of colonies when oriented perpendicular to the direction of incident light. Formation of high aspect ratio cells and colonies may represent an adaptation to maximize light harvesting in low light environments through interaction with the low velocity shear fields commonly found along pycnoclines at the base of the surface mixed layer. The effect of orientation on light absorption by large chain forming diatoms could influence their abundance and distribution in the ocean as well as the broader structure and function of marine ecosystems.},

Under physiological conditions, production of ROS/RNS is tightly regulated by endogenous antioxidants. However, when the balance between ROS/RNS production and antioxidant defense is disturbed, oxidative stress develops. In addition to causing direct cell injury, there is increasing evidence that oxidative stress can activate cell signaling pathways, leading to nuclear receptor activation, autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, or even cell death through apoptosis or necrosis. It is believed that these occur in the mechanisms of liver injury in many etiologies, and biomarkers of oxidative stress have become useful tools for mechanistic investigations in both basic and translational research. Here, we discuss the sources of ROS and RNS in the liver, the pathophysiological consequences of oxidative stress, endogenous antioxidant defenses, and the therapeutic potential of pharmacological antioxidants.},

  abstract = {:  Over the years, many reviews of different aspects of diatom biology, ecology and evolution have appeared. Since 1993 many molecular trees have been produced to infer diatom phylogeny. In 2004, Medlin \& Kaczmarska revised the systematics of the diatoms based on more than 20 years of consistent recovery of two major clades of diatoms that did not correspond to a traditional concept of centrics and pennates and established three classes of diatoms: Clade 1 = Coscinodiscophyceae (radial centrics) and Clade 2 = Mediophyceae (polar centrics + radial Thalassiosirales) and Bacillariophyceae (pennates). However, under certain analytical conditions, an alternative view of diatom evolution, a grades of clades, has been recovered that suggests a gradual evolution from centric to pennate symmetry. These two schemes of diatom evolution are evaluated in terms of whether or not the criteria advocated by Medlin \& Kaczmarska that should be met to recover monophyletic classes have been used. The monophyly of the three diatom classes can only be achieved if (1) a secondary structure of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene was used to construct the alignment and not an alignment based on primary structure and (2) multiple outgroups were used. These requirements have not been met in each study of diatom evolution; hence, the grade of clades, which is useful in reconstructing the sequence of evolution, is not useful for accepting the new classification of the diatoms. Evidence for how these two factors affect the recovery of the three monophyletic classes is reviewed here. The three classes have been defined by clear morphological differences primarily based on gametangia and auxospore ontogeny and envelope structure, the presence or absence of a structure (tube process or sternum) associated with the annulus and the location of the cribrum in those genera with loculate areolae. New evidence supporting the three clades is reviewed. Other features of the cell are examined to determine whether they can also be used to support the monophyly of the three classes.},

Previous studies have shown that the group is divided into two major clades, with support coming initially from the arrangement of the Golgi bodies inside the cells in extant taxa. Features of extinct taxa that also support these clades can be found in the earliest fossil record of the diatoms and include the presence or absence of a central structure in the valve wall and the type of peripheral linking mechanisms between cells. Here we demonstrate that the general pattern of the auxospore expansion and the structure of their walls, the structure of the pyrenoid and the ultrastructure of the spermatozoid further support the molecular clades. Given the combined molecular and morphological support, we propose two new subdivisions (Coscinodiscophytina and Bacillariophytina), emend the classes Coscinodiscophyceae and Bacillariophyceae and propose a new class, the Mediophyceae for the bipolar centrics and the Thalassiosirales.},

Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase activity and stability in vivo were found to be highly susceptible to oxidative stress, resulting in intermolecular cross-linking of large subunits by disulfide bonds within the holoenzyme, rapid and specific translocation of the soluble enzyme complex to the chloroplast membranes, and finally protein degradation. The redox state of Cys-247 in Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit seems involved in the sensitivity of the holoenzyme to oxidative inactivation and cross-linking. However, this process did not drive membrane attachment or degradation of Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase in vivo. Translocation of oxidized Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase to chloroplast membranes may be a necessary step in its turnover, particularly during leaf senescence. Thus, processes that regulate the redox state of plant cells seem closely intertwined with cellular switches shifting the leaf from growth and maturation to senescence and death.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, which numerically dominate vast oceanic areas, are the two most abundant oxygenic phototrophs on Earth. Although they require solar energy for photosynthesis, excess light and associated high UV radiations can induce high levels of oxidative stress that may have deleterious effects on their growth and productivity. Here, we compared the photophysiologies of the model strains Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803 grown under a bell-shaped light/dark cycle of high visible light supplemented or not with UV. Prochlorococcus exhibited a higher sensitivity to photoinactivation than Synechococcus under both conditions, as shown by a larger drop of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield at noon and different diel patterns of the D1 protein pool. In the presence of UV, the PSII repair rate was significantly depressed at noon in Prochlorococcus compared to Synechococcus. Additionally, Prochlorococcus was more sensitive than Synechococcus to oxidative stress, as shown by the different degrees of PSII photoinactivation after addition of hydrogen peroxide. A transcriptional analysis also revealed dramatic discrepancies between the two organisms in the diel expression patterns of several genes involved notably in the biosynthesis and/or repair of photosystems, light-harvesting complexes, CO2 fixation as well as protection mechanisms against light, UV, and oxidative stress, which likely translate profound differences in their light-controlled regulation. Altogether our results suggest that while Synechococcus has developed efficient ways to cope with light and UV stress, Prochlorococcus cells seemingly survive stressful hours of the day by launching a minimal set of protection mechanisms and by temporarily bringing down several key metabolic processes. This study provides unprecedented insights into understanding the distinct depth distributions and dynamics of these two picocyanobacteria in the field.},

The different algae age was obtained by changes in flow rate of continually stirred tank reactors prior to NP exposure. Increased algae age led to a decreased growth, variations in chlorophyll content, and an increased lipid peroxidation. Increased initial algae population (0.3-4.2 \texttimes{} 10(6) cells/mL) at a constant NP concentration (100 mg/L) caused a decline in the growth of algae. With increased initial algae population, the lipid peroxidation and chlorophyll both initially decreased and then increased. Lipid peroxidation had 4\texttimes{} the amount of the control at high and low initial population but, at mid-ranged initial population, had approximately half the control value. Chlorophyll a results also showed a similar trend. These results indicate that the physiological state of the algae is important for the toxicological effect of TiO(2) NPs. The condition of algae and exposure regime must be considered in detail when assessing the toxicological response of NPs to algae.}

ATCC 51142 demonstrated important modifications to photosystem II (PSII) centers when grown under light/dark N2-fixing conditions. The properties of PSII were studied throughout the diurnal cycle using O2-flash-yield and pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorescence techniques. Nonphotochemical quenching (q N) of PSII increased during N2 fixation and persisted after treatments known to induce transitions to state 1. Theq N was high in cells grown in the dark, and then disappeared progressively during the first 4 h of light growth. The photoactivation probability, {$\epsilon$}, demonstrated interesting oscillations, with peaks near 3 h of darkness and 4 and 10 h of light. Experiments and calculations of the S-state distribution indicated that PSII displays a high level of heterogeneity, especially as the cells prepare for N2 fixation. We conclude that the oxidizing side of PSII is strongly affected during the period before and after the peak of nitrogenase activity; changes include a lowered capacity for O2 evolution, altered dark stability of PSII centers, and substantial changes in q N.},

As a response, the capacity of antioxidative defence mechanisms increases. However, when cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were shifted from dark to high light, a reversible partial inactivation of catalase activity was observed, which correlated with a transient increase in the level of H2 O2 in the 10\,{$\mu$}m range. This concentration range seems to be necessary to activate H2 O2 -dependent signalling pathways stimulating the expression of H2 O2 responsive genes, such as the heat shock protein HSP22C. Catalase knock-down mutants had lost the transient accumulation of H2 O2 , suggesting that a decrease in catalase activity was the key element for establishing a transient H2 O2 burst. Catalase was inactivated by a one-electron event consistent with the reduction of a single cysteine. We propose that under high light intensity, the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain is sensed and transmitted to the cytosol to regulate the catalase activity. This allows a transient accumulation of H2 O2 , inducing a signalling event that is transmitted to the nucleus to modulate the expression of chloroplast-directed protection enzymes.},

They provide a means by which patterns in biology can be quantified and an explanation from physics can be correlated with such patterns. In this thesis, I use scaling laws to look for connections between biology and physics in two systems, diatom frustules and coralline algal reproduction. In Part I, I investigate diatom sinking speeds, a system for which a biologically derived scaling law has been known for some time, but is yet to be explained by a physically derived correlate (Chapter 1). Once I solve this discrepancy between the physical and biological scaling laws, I then spend the rest of the Part I deriving several other related scaling laws, from physical (Chapters 2 and 4) and biological (Chapter 3) perspectives. Part II works with an entirely new system for which few scaling laws have been derived, the spores of red algae and their attachment ability. This second part of my thesis works primarily from a biological perspective, as I empirically derive scaling laws and try to make sense of a new system.},

However, how cells spatially regulate H2O2 to achieve physiological redox signaling over nonspecific oxidative stress pathways is insufficiently understood. Here we report that the water channel Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) can facilitate the uptake of H2O2 into mammalian cells and mediate downstream intracellular signaling. Molecular imaging with Peroxy Yellow 1 Methyl-Ester (PY1-ME), a new chemoselective fluorescent indicator for H2O2, directly demonstrates that aquaporin isoforms AQP3 and AQP8, but not AQP1, can promote uptake of H2O2 specifically through membranes in mammalian cells. Moreover, we show that intracellular H2O2 accumulation can be modulated up or down based on endogenous AQP3 expression, which in turn can influence downstream cell signaling cascades. Finally, we establish that AQP3 is required for Nox-derived H2O2 signaling upon growth factor stimulation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the downstream intracellular effects of H2O2 can be regulated across biological barriers, a discovery that has broad implications for the controlled use of this potentially toxic small molecule for beneficial physiological functions.},

At a given salinity, the rates increase as a function of [H+] to the 1.3{$\pm$}0.1 power. Speciation calculations indicate that this slope is related to the concentration of Cu(OH)2 which is reactive to reduction with H2O2. The increase in the rates with increasing ionic strength or salinity is due to the increasing Cl- concentration. The rates increase with increasing chloride to the 1.8{$\pm$}0.2 power. The pH and Cl- results indicate that in seawater the reactive species may be Cu(OH)2Cl22-. The reaction of the dichloro Cu(II) complex leads to the formation of the dichloro Cu(I) complex, that is resistant to oxidation with O2 and H2O2. Measurements in the major sea salts indicate that the rates in seawater are nearly the same as in NaCl at the same level of Cl- and HCO3-. Measurements in NaCl with increasing levels of NaHCO3 and NaH(OH)4 at the same pH indicate that CuCO3 and Cu(CO3)22- are non-reactive, while CuB(OH)4+ is reactive to reduction with H2O2.},

The rapid systemic signal was triggered by wounding, heat, cold, high-intensity light, and salinity stresses.

SODs therefore acquired great importance as O2 became prevalent following the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Thus the three forms of SOD provide intriguing insights into the evolution of the organisms and organelles that carry them today. Although ancient organisms employed Fe-dependent SODs, oxidation of the environment made Fe less bio-available, and more dangerous. Indeed, modern lineages make greater use of homologous Mn-dependent SODs. Our studies on the Fe-substituted MnSOD of Escherichia coli, as well as redox tuning in the FeSOD of E. coli shed light on how evolution accommodated differences between Fe and Mn that could affect SOD performance, in SOD proteins whose activity is specific to one or other metal ion.},

Because TiO2 generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), nanoparticulate TiO2 has been used in antibacterial coatings and wastewater disinfection, and has been investigated as an anti-cancer agent. Oxidative stress mediated by photoactive TiO2 is the likely mechanism of its toxicity, and experiments demonstrating cytotoxicity of TiO2 have used exposure to strong artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). In vivo tests of TiO2 toxicity with aquatic organisms have typically shown low toxicity, and results across studies have been variable. No work has demonstrated that photoactivity causes environmental toxicity of TiO2 under natural levels of UVR. Here we show that relatively low levels of ultraviolet light, consistent with those found in nature, can induce toxicity of TiO2 nanoparticles to marine phytoplankton, the most important primary producers on Earth. No effect of TiO2 on phytoplankton was found in treatments where UV light was blocked. Under low intensity UVR, ROS in seawater increased with increasing nano-TiO2 concentration. These increases may lead to increased overall oxidative stress in seawater contaminated by TiO2, and cause decreased resiliency of marine ecosystems. Phototoxicity must be considered when evaluating environmental impacts of nanomaterials, many of which are photoactive.},

This article describes two flow injection\textemdash chemiluminescence methods to measure H2O2 and O2- production by marine diatoms. These methods each incorporated a polycarbonate filter unit in which live cells were immobilized, followed by downstream determination of H2O2 and O2- in the cell filtrate. The sample analysis rate was 1 min-1 for H2O2 and continuous for O2- during assays with diatom cells. The respective detection limits for each system were 1.9 nM (H2O2) and 1.6 nM (O2-). An initial examination of the effect of changing light intensity showed that a rapid light-induced production of both O2- and H2O2 by T. weissflogii cells could be readily detected. Moreover, this production was proportional to the biomass present on the flushed filter. These methods enable the monitoring of real-time fluctuations of biological ROS production in response to changing environmental conditions, and therefore facilitate analysis of the biotic component of ROS production and the subsequent impacts on chemical speciation of nutrients and trace metals in aquatic ecosystems.},

This review describes most successful mitochondrially-targeted redox-active compounds, Mn porphyrins and MitoQ10 in detail, and briefly addresses several other compounds that are either catalysts of O2{$\cdot-$} dismutation, or its non-catalytic scavengers, and that reportedly attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction. While not a true catalyst (SOD mimic) of O2{$\cdot-$} dismutation, MitoQ10 oxidizes O2{$\cdot-$} to O2 with a high rate constant. In vivo it is readily reduced to quinol, MitoQH2, which in turn reduces ONOO- to {$\cdot$}NO2, producing semiquinone radical that subsequently dismutes to MitoQ10 and MitoQH2, completing the ``catalytic'' cycle. In MitoQ10, the redox-active unit was coupled to alkyl chain and monocationic triphenylphosphonium ion in order to reach mitochondria. Mn porphyrin-based SOD mimics, however, were designed so that their multiple cationic charge and alkyl chains determine both their remarkable SOD potency and carry them into mitochondria. Several animal efficacy studies such as skin carcinogenesis and UVB-mediated mtDNA damage, and subcellular distribution studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mouse heart provided unambiguous evidence that Mn porphyrins mimic the site and action of MnSOD, which in turn contributes to their efficacy in numerous in vitro and in vivo models of oxidative stress. Within a class of Mn porphyrins, lipophilic analogues are particularly effective for treating central nervous system injuries where mitochondria play key role.},

Principal Findings We show that some frustule designs constrain diffusion to positively alter nutrient uptake. In nutrient gradients of 4 to 160 times over {$<$}5 cm, the screened-chambered morphology of Coscincodiscus sp. biases the nutrient diffusion towards the cell by at least 3.8 times the diffusion to the seawater. In contrast, the open-chambers of Thalassiosira eccentrica produce at least a 1.3 times diffusion advantage to the membrane over Coscincodiscus sp. when nutrients are homogeneous. Significance Diffusion constraint explains the success of particular diatom species at given times and the overall success of diatoms. The results help answer the unresolved question of how adjacent microplankton compete. Furthermore, diffusion constraint by supramembrane nanostructures to alter molecular diffusion suggests that microbes compete via supramembrane topology, a competitive mechanism not considered by the standard smooth-surface equations used for nutrient uptake nor in microbial ecology and cell physiology.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) control many different processes in plants. However, being toxic molecules, they are also capable of injuring cells. How this conflict is resolved in plants is largely unknown. Nonetheless, it is clear that the steady-state level of ROS in cells needs to be tightly regulated. In Arabidopsis, a network of at least 152 genes is involved in managing the level of ROS. This network is highly dynamic and redundant, and encodes ROS-scavenging and ROS-producing proteins. Although recent studies have unraveled some of the key players in the network, many questions related to its mode of regulation, its protective roles and its modulation of signaling networks that control growth, development and stress response remain unanswered.},

Unicellular eukaryotic diatoms are the main primary producers in this environment, where photosynthesis is limited by low concentrations of dissolved iron and large seasonal fluctuations in light, temperature and the extent of sea ice3,4,5,6,7. How diatoms have adapted to this extreme environment is largely unknown. Here we present insights into the genome evolution of a cold-adapted diatom from the Southern Ocean, Fragilariopsis cylindrus8,9, based on a comparison with temperate diatoms. We find that approximately 24.7 per cent of the diploid F. cylindrus genome consists of genetic loci with alleles that are highly divergent (15.1 megabases of the total genome size of 61.1 megabases). These divergent alleles were differentially expressed across environmental conditions, including darkness, low iron, freezing, elevated temperature and increased CO2. Alleles with the largest ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions also show the most pronounced condition-dependent expression, suggesting a correlation between diversifying selection and allelic differentiation. Divergent alleles may be involved in adaptation to environmental fluctuations in the Southern Ocean.},

The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

For the dinoflagellate Kryptoperidinium foliaceum, which has been described as having one of the most elaborate eyespot complexes known, positive phototaxis has hitherto not been reported. In this study, we show that a newly isolated strain of K. foliaceum is indeed capable of positive phototaxis with a mean vector ({$\pm$} 95\% confidence interval) of 352\textdegree{$\pm$} 2.2, where 0/360\textdegree{} indicates the position of the light source. A study of three strains (UTEX 1688, CCMP 1326, and MBL07) of K. foliaceum showed that the eyespot in two of these strains has degenerated following decades in culture. Thus, previous studies have failed to report positive phototaxis due to loss of directionality caused by the degenerated eyespot. The results are discussed in a broader context and we conclude that studies on algal morphology and physiology may result in erroneous conclusions if based on algal cultures maintained under laboratory conditions for extended periods.},

Physical interactions of these species with cellular membranes~are discussed extensively, but also their relevance to chemical reactions such as lipid peroxidation. Most of these species are involved in different cellular redox processes ranging from physiological pathways to damaging reactions against biomolecules. Cell membranes separate and compartmentalize different processes, inside or outside cells, and in different organelles within cells. The permeability of these membranes to reactive species varies according to the physicochemical properties of each molecule. Some of them, such as nitric oxide and oxygen, are small and hydrophobic and can traverse cellular membranes virtually unhindered. Nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen sulfide find a slightly higher barrier to permeation, but still their diffusion is largely unimpeded by cellular membranes. In contrast, the permeability of cellular membranes to the more polar hydrogen peroxide, is up to five orders of magnitude lower, allowing the formation of concentration gradients, directionality and effective compartmentalization of its actions which can be further regulated by specific aquaporins that facilitate its diffusion through membranes. The compartmentalizing effect on anionic species such as superoxide and peroxynitrite is even more accentuated because of the large energetic barrier that the hydrophobic interior of membranes presents to ions that may be overcome by protonation or the use of anion channels. The large difference in cell membrane permeability for different reactive species indicates that compartmentalization is possible for some but not all of them.},

Here we argue that peptides deriving from proteolytic breakdown of oxidatively damaged proteins have the requisite specificity to act as secondary ROS messengers and regulate source-specific genes and in this way contribute to retrograde ROS signalling during oxidative stress. Likewise, unmodified peptides deriving from the breakdown of redundant proteins could help coordinate organellar and nuclear gene expression.},

The motile vegetative stage and the cyst produced in the culture were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron micrscopy (TEM).

In the Atlantic Ocean, these 2 picoplankters exhibit different spatial and seasonal distributions. In order to better understand the ecology of these species, we measured growth and photoacclimation responses including fluorescence excitation [F*ph({$\lambda$})] and in vivo absorption [a*ph({$\lambda$})] spectra over a range of growth irradiances for P. marinus (clone SS120) and Synechococcus WH8103, both isolated from the Sargasso Sea. To explore the physiological diversity of P. marinus, we measured the physiological responses of another P. marinus clone, MED4, isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate as a function of temperature was also examined for all 3 clones. P. marinus SS120 and Synechococcus WH8103 have different temperature optima for growth, but these do not explain the different latitudinal distributions in the North Atlantic. P. marinus SSI20 is adapted for growth at low light intensities relative to Synechococcus WH8103, which is consistent with the relative depth distribution of P. marinus and Synechococcus in the field. The light-dependent growth response of P. marinus MED4 is more similar to Synechococcus WH8103 than to P. marinus SS120. The unique pigment content of P. marinus (which contain divinyl chlorophylls a and b) results in maximal absorbance in the blue wavelengths. The high total chl b/chl a ratio of P. marinus SS120 enables it to absorb more light, grow faster than Synechococcus WH8103 (and P. marinus MED4) at low light intensities, and presumably to outcompete Synechococcus in the deep euphotic zone. At high growth irradiances, P. marinus SS120 contains measureable amounts of normal (monovinyl) chl b, whereas this pigment was not found in P. marinus MED4 at any growth irradiance. Photoacclimative changes in pigment ratios, and not package effect, account for most of the changes in a*ph({$\lambda$}) and F*ph({$\lambda$}) with light intensity for all 3 picoplankters. At high light intensities, zeaxanthin contributes substantially to a*ph({$\lambda$}) in the blue, but appears to transfer little or no excitation energy to the reaction centers, based on F*ph({$\lambda$}) measurements. For P. marinus, high absorption in the blue due to divinyl chl a and b relative to normal chl a and b, absorption due to zeaxanthin, and small cell size result in unusually high a*ph (blue) relative to a*ph (red).},

  abstract = {Cultured isolates of Prochlorococcus from the Mediterranean Sea (MED4) and Sargasso Sea (SS120) have been shown to have dramatically different pigment composition and growth rate responses when grown over a range of irradiances. Moreover, analyses of field populations in the North Atlantic have shown that distinct ecotypes can coexist in the same water column. These and other observations have led to the hypothesis that Prochlorococcus is comprised of genetically distinct ecotypes that collectively expand the range of light intensities over which the genus can thrive. In this paper, we explore this hypothesis by comparing the photophysiology of 10 different Prochlorococcus isolates from diverse oceanographic regimes. We found that the 10 isolates could be grouped into two loose clusters based on their growth response to varying light intensity and their chlorophyll b/a2 (Chl b/a2) ratios. Although both groups photoacclimate when grown over a range of light intensities, isolates with distinctly higher Chl b/a2 ratios (high B/A ecotype) reach maximal growth rates at lower irradiances (Ik,g), have high growth efficiencies ({$\alpha$}g), and are inhibited in growth at irradiances where isolates with low Chl b/a2 ratios (low B/A ecotype) are growing maximally. High Chl b/a2 ratios resulted in higher spectrally weighted average Chl a2-specific absorption coefficient (\=achl*), Chl a2 specific light-harvesting efficiency ({$\alpha$}chla), and quantum yield ({$\varphi$}m) under low growth irradiances for the isolates of the high B/A ecotype relative to the others. The distinction between the high and low B/A ecotypes is supported by molecular phylogenies constructed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene.

  abstract = {Analysis of a global compilation of dissolved-iron observations provides insights into the processes controlling iron distributions and some constraints for ocean biogeochemical models. The distribution of dissolved iron appears consistent with the conceptual model developed for Th isotopes, whereby particle scavenging is a two-step process of scavenging mainly by colloidal and small particulates, followed by aggregation and removal on larger sinking particles. Much of the dissolved iron ({$<$}0.4 \textmu m) is present as small colloids ({$>\sim$}0.02 \textmu m) and, thus, is subject to aggregation and scavenging removal. This implies distinct scavenging regimes for dissolved iron consistent with the observations: 1) a high scavenging regime \textendash{} where dissolved-iron concentrations exceed the concentrations of strongly binding organic ligands; and 2) a moderate scavenging regime \textendash where dissolved iron is bound to both colloidal and soluble ligands. Within the moderate scavenging regime, biological uptake and particle scavenging decrease surface iron concentrations to low levels ({$<$}0.2 nM) over a wide range of low to moderate iron input levels. Removal rates are also highly nonlinear in areas with higher iron inputs. Thus, observed surface-iron concentrations exhibit a bi-modal distribution and are a poor proxy for iron input rates. Our results suggest that there is substantial removal of dissolved iron from subsurface waters (where iron concentrations are often well below 0.6 nM), most likely due to aggregation and removal on sinking particles of Fe bound to organic colloids.},

The tiniest members of this planktonic group comprise cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae smaller than 2??m in diameter, collectively known as picophytoplankton. We combine here two ecological rules, the temperature?size relationship with the allometric size-scaling of population abundance to explain a remarkably consistent pattern of increasing picophytoplankton biomass with temperature over the ?0.6 to 22?\textdegree C range in a merged dataset obtained in the eastern and western temperate North Atlantic Ocean across a diverse range of environmental conditions. Our results show that temperature alone was able to explain 73\% of the variance in the relative contribution of small cells to total phytoplankton biomass regardless of differences in trophic status or inorganic nutrient loading. Our analysis predicts a gradual shift toward smaller primary producers in a warmer ocean. Because the fate of photosynthesized organic carbon largely depends on phytoplankton size, we anticipate future alterations in the functioning of oceanic ecosystems.},

The spectral values of light absorption, scattering and backscattering of intact cells in suspension were determined, together with cell counts, size distribution and pigment composition (via HPLC). The spectral efficiency factors Qa, Qb, Qbb for light absorption, scattering and backscattering respectively, were derived, as well as the corresponding chlorophyll-specific coefficients a*, b* and bb*. The pigment used when normalizing is ``true'' chlorophyll a for Synechococcus, and divinyl-chlorophyll a for Prochlorococcus. In correspondence with small sizes (0.6 {$\mu$}m, on average) Prochlorococcus exhibits Qb values below those of Synechococcus (size about 0.9 {$\mu$}m, on average). In contrast, Qa is higher for Prochlorococcus than for Synechococcus, in response to high internal divinyl-chlorophyll content. In the blue part of the spectrum the probability for photons of being absorbed by a Prochlorococcus cell exceeds that of being scattered. Such a combination has never been found before for other algal cells, consistently more efficient as scatterers than as absorbers. The magnitude of the three efficiency Q-factors, as well as their spectral variations, can be understood and reconstructed in the frame of the Mie theory. The impact of these small organisms, dominant in oligotrophic environment, upon the optical properties of such waters are discussed on the basis of their chlorophyll-specific optical coefficients. Their absorption capabilities (per unit of chlorophyll) are not far from being maximum, to the extent that the package effect is rather reduced. With respect to scattering, Prochlorococcus cells have a minute signature compared to that of Synechococcus. This point is illustrated using vertical profiles of fluorescence, attenuation coefficient, cell number, Chl a and divinyl-Chl a concentrations, as observed in an oligotrophic tropical situation. Even if the backscattering-to-scattering ratio is, as theoretically expected, higher for Prochlorococcus than for all other algae (including Synechococcus), their light backscattering capacity definitely remains negligible.}

The isolate was capable of good growth at 40\textdegree C under an airstream enriched with 10\% CO2. The maximum photosynthetic productivity was 34.4g of dry biomass/(m2 of installation area {$\cdot$} d) (12-h light/12-h dark cycle) when the cells were illuminated with an average photosynthetic photon flux density (photosynthetically active radiation ([PAR] 400\textendash 700 nm) simulating the outdoors in central Japan (0.980 mmol photons/[m2{$\cdot$}s]). This corresponded to a photosynthetic efficiency of 8.67\% (PAR), which was defined as the percentage of the light energy recovered as biomass (394 kJ/[reactor{$\cdot$}d]) to the total light energy received (4545 kJ/[reactor{$\cdot$}d]). A similarly high photosynthetic efficiency (8.12\% [PAR]) was also attained in the combined presence of 10\% CO2, 100 ppm of NO, and 25 ppm of SO2. Moreover, good photosynthetic productivity was also obtained under high temperature and high light intensity conditions (maximum temperature, 46.5\textdegree C; 1.737 mmol photons/[m2{$\cdot$}s]), when simulating the strong irradiance of the midday summer sun. This strain thus appears well suited for practical application for converting CO2 present in the stack gases emitted by thermal power plants and should be feasible even during the hot summer weather.},

This partitioning of benefits, also called `leakiness', can produce negative frequency dependence of fitness in microbial communities, allowing coexistence between function-performing helpers and function-requiring beneficiaries. The ubiquity of leakiness favors a `race to the bottom' as members of a community lose the ability to perform functions whose products are available from the environment. Rather than being social altruists, helpers are merely those populations that lost this race and got stuck in their role as function performers. Here I discuss many such BQ functions and the microbial communities that evolve around them. I also compile evidence from laboratory evolution experiments as well as phylogenetic reconstructions that show that organisms gain greater fitness increases from gene/function loss events than is commonly expected. Finally, I consider possible consequences of long-term BQ-stabilized coexistence, including sympatric speciation and the evolution of true mutualisms.},

Given that sunlight is the primary source of HOOH, we investigated the relationship between time of day and microbial HOOH degradation.

While bacterial catalase-peroxidases were the most abundant transcripts, the abundance of algal peroxidases, along with the insensitivity of HOOH degradation rates to antibiotic treatment in our incubations, suggested that eukaryotic microorganisms were also important scavengers of HOOH. Phylogenetic placement of transcripts for HOOH degrading enzymes suggested that different taxa expressed these enzymes during the day than during the night. We also measured HOOH concentrations over a 24 h period in the South Pacific, and simultaneously conducted bottle incubations to measure HOOH dark degradation rates. Fitting these data to a dynamic model confirmed that the ability of the microbial community to degrade HOOH during the day increased, with peak HOOH removal rates occurring in late afternoon coincident with the highest HOOH concentrations. Collectively, these data suggest that even in dilute HOOH environments, there is a dynamic diel response to HOOH, and that the open ocean microbial community is complicit in its cross-protection of Prochlorococcus and other HOOH-sensitive taxa.},

ROS can directly affect the growth of marine organisms, and can also influence marine biogeochemistry, thus indirectly impacting the availability of nutrients and food sources. Microbial communities and evolution are shaped by marine ROS, and in turn microorganisms influence steady-state ROS concentrations by acting as the predominant sink for marine ROS. Through their interactions with trace metals and organic matter, ROS can enhance microbial growth, but ROS can also attack biological macromolecules, causing extensive modifications with deleterious results. Several biogeochemically important taxa are vulnerable to very low ROS concentrations within the ranges measured in situ, including the globally distributed marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus and ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota. Finally, climate change may increase the amount of ROS in the ocean, especially in the most productive surface layers. In this review, we explore the sources of ROS and their roles in the oceans, how the dynamics of ROS might change in the future, and how this change might impact the ecology and chemistry of the future ocean.},

Moreover, our results indicate that during chronic exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of Cu2+, the cells tune down their metabolic rate to invest energy in the activation of detoxification mechanisms, which eventually result in a remarkable recovery. In contrast, the toxic effects of Cd2+ are cumulative. Unexpectedly, the amount of released polysaccharides (RPS) was not enhanced by the presence of heavy metals. Biological significance This work shows the holistic effects of different heavy metals on the cells of the highly efficient EPS-producer the cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. CCY 0110. The growth/survival, EPS production, ultrastructure, protein profiles and stress response were evaluated. The knowledge generated by this study will contribute to the implementation of heavy-metal removal systems based on cyanobacteria EPS or their isolated polymers.},

The tertiary structures of PNOX with a C-terminal His6-tag and PNOX\textendash pyridoxamine (PM) complex were determined at 2.2\AA{} and at 2.1\AA{} resolutions, respectively. The overall structure consisted of FAD-binding and substrate-binding domains. In the active site, His460, His462, and Pro504 were located on the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. PM binds to the active site through several hydrogen bonds. The side chains of His462 and His460 are located at 2.7 and 3.1\AA{} from the N4{${'}$} atom of PM. The activities of His460Ala and His462Ala mutant PNOXs were very low, and 460Ala/His462Ala double mutant PNOX exhibited no activity. His462 may act as a general base for the abstraction of a proton from the 4{${'}$}-hydroxyl of PN. His460 may play a role in the binding and positioning of PN. The C4{${'}$} atom in PM is located at 3.2\AA, and the hydride ion from the C4{${'}$} atom may be transferred to the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring. The comparison of active site residues in GMC oxidoreductase shows that Pro504 in PNOX corresponds to Asn or His of the conserved His\textendash Asn or His\textendash His pair in other GMC oxidoreductases. The function of the novel proline residue was discussed.},

  abstract = {Diatoms are a highly diverse group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that are distributed throughout marine and freshwater environments and are believed to be responsible for approximately 40\% of the total marine primary productivity. The ecological success of diatoms suggests that they have developed a range of strategies to cope with various biotic and abiotic stress factors. It is of great interest to understand the adaptive responses of diatoms to different stresses in the marine environment. Proteomic technologies have been applied to the adaptive responses of marine diatoms under different growth conditions in recent years such as nitrogen starvation, iron limitation and phosphorus deficiency. These studies have provided clues to elucidate the sophisticated sensing mechanisms that control their adaptive responses. Although only a very limited number of proteomic studies were conducted in diatoms, the obtained data have led to a better understanding of the biochemical processes that contribute to their ecological success. This review presents the current status of proteomic studies of diatom stress responses and discusses the novel developments and applications for the analysis of protein post-translational modification in diatoms. The potential future application of proteomics could contribute to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying diatom acclimation to a given stress and the acquisition of an enhanced diatom stress tolerance. Future challenges and research opportunities in the proteomics studies of diatoms are also discussed.},

Since the first essentially complete eukaryotic proteome was reported1, advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics2 have enabled increasingly comprehensive identification and quantification of the human proteome3\textendash 6. However, there have been few comparisons across species7,8, in stark contrast with genomics initiatives9. Here we use an advanced proteomics workflow\textemdash in which the peptide separation step is performed by a microstructured and extremely reproducible chromatographic system\textemdash for the in-depth study of 100 taxonomically diverse organisms. With two million peptide and 340,000 stringent protein identifications obtained in a standardized manner, we double the number of proteins with solid experimental evidence known to the scientific community. The data also provide a large-scale case study for sequence-based machine learning, as we demonstrate by experimentally confirming the predicted properties of peptides from Bacteroides uniformis. Our results offer a comparative view of the functional organization of organisms across the entire evolutionary range. A remarkably high fraction of the total proteome mass in all kingdoms is dedicated to protein homeostasis and folding, highlighting the biological challenge of maintaining protein structure in all branches of life. Likewise, a universally high fraction is involved in supplying energy resources, although these pathways range from photosynthesis through iron sulfur metabolism to carbohydrate metabolism. Generally, however, proteins and proteomes are remarkably diverse between organisms, and they can readily be explored and functionally compared at www.proteomesoflife.org.},

  abstract = {Like all aerobic organisms, plants and algae co-opt reactive oxygen species (ROS) as signalling molecules to drive cellular responses to changes in their environment. In this respect, there is considerable commonality between all eukaryotes imposed by the constraints of ROS chemistry, similar metabolism in many subcellular compartments, the requirement for a high degree of signal specificity and the deployment of thiol peroxidases as transducers of oxidising equivalents to regulatory proteins. Nevertheless, plants and algae carry out specialised signalling arising from oxygenic photosynthesis in chloroplasts and photoautotropism, which often induce an imbalance between absorption of light energy and the capacity to use it productively. A key means of responding to this imbalance is through communication of chloroplasts with the nucleus to adjust cellular metabolism. Two ROS, singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiate distinct signalling pathways when photosynthesis is perturbed. 1O2, because of its potent reactivity means that it initiates but does not transduce signalling. In contrast, the lower reactivity of H2O2 means that it can also be a mobile messenger in a spatially-defined signalling pathway. How plants translate a H2O2 message to bring about changes in gene expression is unknown and therefore, we draw on information from other eukaryotes to propose a working hypothesis. The role of these ROS generated in other subcellular compartments of plant cells in response to HL is critically considered alongside other eukaryotes. Finally, the responses of animal cells to oxidative stress upon high irradiance exposure is considered for new comparisons between plant and animal cells.},

In view of their evolutionary history from a secondary endosymbiosis, inter-organellar regulation of biochemical activities may be of particular relevance. Diatom mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) is believed to play a significant role in supplying chloroplasts with ATP produced in the mitochondria. Using the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum we generated AOX knockdown lines, and followed sensitivity to stressors, photosynthesis and transcriptome and metabolome profiles of wild-type and knockdown lines. We show here that expression of the AOX gene is upregulated by various stresses including H2O2, heat, high light illumination, and iron or nitrogen limitation. AOX knockdown results in hypersensitivity to stress. Knockdown lines also show significantly reduced photosynthetic rates and their chloroplasts are more oxidized. Comparisons of transcriptome and metabolome profiles suggest a strong impact of AOX activity on gene expression, which is carried through to the level of the metabolome. Our data provide evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial AOX in processes central to the cell biology of diatoms, revealing that cross-talk between mitochondria and chloroplasts is crucial for maintaining sensitivity to changing environments.},

  abstract = {The production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) by mammalian mitochondria is important because it underlies oxidative damage in many pathologies and contributes to retrograde redox signalling from the organelle to the cytosol and nucleus. Superoxide (O2\textbullet -) is the proximal mitochondrial ROS, and in the present review I outline the principles that govern O2\textbullet - production within the matrix of mammalian mitochondria. The flux of O2\textbullet - is related to the concentration of potential electron donors, the local concentration of O2 and the second-order rate constants for the reactions between them. Two modes of operation by isolated mitochondria result in significant O2\textbullet - production, predominantly from complex I: (i) when the mitochondria are not making ATP and consequently have a high {$\Delta$}p (protonmotive force) and a reduced CoQ (coenzyme Q) pool; and (ii) when there is a high NADH/NAD+ ratio in the mitochondrial matrix. For mitochondria that are actively making ATP, and consequently have a lower {$\Delta$}p and NADH/NAD+ ratio, the extent of O2\textbullet - production is far lower. The generation of O2\textbullet - within the mitochondrial matrix depends critically on {$\Delta$}p, the NADH/NAD+ and CoQH2/CoQ ratios and the local O2 concentration, which are all highly variable and difficult to measure in vivo. Consequently, it is not possible to estimate O2\textbullet - generation by mitochondria in vivo from O2\textbullet --production rates by isolated mitochondria, and such extrapolations in the literature are misleading. Even so, the description outlined here facilitates the understanding of factors that favour mitochondrial ROS production. There is a clear need to develop better methods to measure mitochondrial O2\textbullet - and H2O2 formation in vivo, as uncertainty about these values hampers studies on the role of mitochondrial ROS in pathological oxidative damage and redox signalling.},

  abstract = {Abstract.  Recently, Guenter Schwarz and colleagues published an elegant study in the Biochemical Journal (2019) 476, 1805\textendash 1815 which combines kinetic and spectroscopic studies with protein engineering to provide a mechanism for sulfite oxidase (SO)-catalyzed nitrite reduction that yields nitric oxide (NO). This work is noteworthy as it demonstrates that (i) for NO generation, both sulfite and nitrite must bind to the same molybdenum (Mo) center; (ii) upon sulfite reduction, Mo is reduced from +6 (MoVI) to +4 (MoIV) and MoIV reduces nitrite to NO yielding MoV; (iii) the heme moiety, linked to the Mo-center by an 11 amino acid residue tether, gets reduced by intramolecular electron transfer (IET) resulting in MoV being oxidized to MoVI; (iv) the reduced heme transfers its electron to a second nitrite molecule converting it to NO; (v) the authors demonstrate steady-state NO production in the presence of the natural electron acceptor cytochrome c; (vi) Finally, the authors use protein engineering to shorten the heme tether to reduce the heme-Mo-center distance with the aim of increasing NO production. Consequently, the rate of IET to cytochrome c is decreased but the enzymatic turnover rate for NO production is increased by {$\sim$}10-fold. This paper is unique as it provides strong evidence for a novel mechanism for steady-state NO production for human mitochondrial SO and serves as a potential template for studying NO production mechanisms in other enzymes by integrating the information gained from enzyme kinetics with EPR and UV/vis spectroscopy and protein engineering.},

  abstract = {During physiological stress, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) degradation is accelerated, which is considered to be one of the key factors responsible for photosynthetic decline. A recent study has shown that the large subunit (RbcL) of Rubisco is directly fragmented by hydroxyl radicals in Cucumis sativus leaves under chilling-light conditions. In the present study, we investigated biochemical aspects associated with this in vivo RbcL fragmentation by reactive oxygen species. RbcL fragmentation was observed in C. sativus and Phaseolus vulgaris, but not in Solanum lycopersicum, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, Spinacia oleracea or Arabidopsis thaliana. In C.~sativus and P.~vulgaris, RbcL fragmentation followed the fragmentation of PsaB, while in the other species, PsaB fragmentation did not occur. In C.~sativus and P.~vulgaris, the activities of antioxidant enzymes decreased dramatically under chilling-light conditions, and the proportion of uncarbamylated Rubisco increased. These data suggest that in vivo RbcL fragmentation under chilling-light conditions is associated with a combination of events, namely, inactivation of antioxidant enzymes, destruction of photosystem I and an increase of uncarbamylated Rubisco, which can produce hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction at the catalytic site of RbcL.},

  abstract = {The prasinophytes comprise a morphologically heterogeneous assembly of mostly marine flagellates and coccoid taxa, which represent an important component of the nano- and picoplankton, and have previously figured prominently in discussions about the origin and phylogeny of the green plants. To evaluate their putative basal position in the Viridiplantae and to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among the prasinophyte taxa, we determined complete nuclear-encoded SSU rRNA sequences from 13 prasinophyte taxa representing the genera Cymbomonas, Halosphaera, Mamiella, Mantoniella, Micromonas, Pterosperma, Pycnococcus, and Pyramimonas. Phylogenetic analyses of SSU rRNA sequences using distance, parsimony and likelihood methods revealed four independent prasi.nophyte lineages (clades) which constitute the earliest divergences among the Chlorophyta. In order of their divergence these clades are represented by the genera Cymbomonas, Halosphaera, Pterosperma, Pyramimonas (clade I), Mamiella, Mantoniella, Micromonas (clade II), Pseudoscourfieldia (strain CCMP 717), Nephroselmis (clade III), and Tetraselmis, Scherffelia (clade IV). The coccoid Pycnococcus provasolii diverged after clade II, but before clade III. Since no other coccoid prasinophyte taxa were analyzed in this study, the phylogenetic status of this taxon is presently unresolved. Our analyses provide further evidence for the basal phylogenetic position of the scaly green flagellates among the Chlorophyta and raise important questions concerning the class-level classification of the Chlorophyta.},

  abstract = {Background Flagella have been lost in the vegetative phase of the diatom life cycle, but they are still present in male gametes of centric species, thereby representing a hallmark of sexual reproduction. This process, besides maintaining and creating new genetic diversity, in diatoms is also fundamental to restore the maximum cell size following its reduction during vegetative division. Nevertheless, sexual reproduction has been demonstrated in a limited number of diatom species, while our understanding of its different phases and of their genetic control is scarce. Results In the transcriptome of Leptocylindrus danicus, a centric diatom widespread in the world's seas, we identified 22 transcripts related to the flagella development and confirmed synchronous overexpression of 6 flagellum-related genes during the male gamete formation process. These transcripts were mostly absent in the closely related species L. aporus, which does not have sexual reproduction. Among the 22 transcripts, L. danicus showed proteins that belong to the Intra Flagellar Transport (IFT) subcomplex B as well as IFT-A proteins, the latter previously thought to be absent in diatoms. The presence of flagellum-related proteins was also traced in the transcriptomes of several other centric species. Finally, phylogenetic reconstruction of the IFT172 and IFT88 proteins showed that their sequences are conserved across protist species and have evolved similarly to other phylogenetic marker genes. Conclusion Our analysis describes for the first time the diatom flagellar gene set, which appears to be more complete and functional than previously reported based on the genome sequence of the model centric diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. This first recognition of the whole set of diatom flagellar genes and of their activation pattern paves the way to a wider recognition of the relevance of sexual reproduction in individual species and in the natural environment.

  abstract = {Plastids have retained from their cyanobacterial ancestor a fragment of the respiratory electron chain comprising an NADPH dehydrogenase and a diiron oxidase, which sustain the so-called chlororespiration pathway. Despite its very low turnover rates compared with photosynthetic electron flow, knocking out the plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) in plants or microalgae leads to severe phenotypes that encompass developmental and growth defects together with increased photosensitivity. On the basis of a phylogenetic and structural analysis of the enzyme, we discuss its physiological contribution to chloroplast metabolism, with an emphasis on its critical function in setting the redox poise of the chloroplast stroma in darkness. The emerging picture of PTOX is that of an enzyme at the crossroads of a variety of metabolic processes, such as, among others, the regulation of cyclic electron transfer and carotenoid biosynthesis, which have in common their dependence on the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, set largely by the activity of PTOX in darkness.},

In this study, the function of the only LONELY GUY gene (CvarLOG1) from unicellular green microalga Chlorella variabilis NC64A has been investigated. CvarLOG1 expressed mainly in the lag and log phases of growth and was confirmed to be a cytokinin-activating enzyme. Overexpression of CvarLOG1 in Chlorella led to extended life in culture by almost 10\textendash 20 days, creating a ``stay-green'' phenotype. In the transformed alga, the cell cycle was lengthened due to delayed entry into the G2/M phase contrary to the known role of cytokinins in stimulating G2/M transition possibly due to excessive levels of this hormone. However, due to the sustained growth and delayed senescence, there was an increase in cell number by 11\% and in biomass by 46\% at the stationary phase, indicating a potential application for the biofuel industry. The total carbohydrate and lipid yield increased by approximately 30 and 20\%, respectively. RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis revealed that the genes associated with light and dark reactions of photosynthesis were upregulated, which may be the reason for the increased biomass. These data show that LOG plays an essential role during the cell cycle and in the functioning of the chloroplast and that the pathway leading to direct activation of cytokinins via LOG is functional in algae.},

Here, we show new optimized fluorescence spectroscopy protocol that allows rapid and specific detection of superoxide in cell free systems and intact cells using dihydroethydium (DHE). We defined new optimized fluorescent settings to measure superoxide specific product and minimize interference of unspecific DHE oxidation products. Using this protocol we studied real time superoxide production by xanthine oxidase and menadione-treated cultured cells. Specificity of the plate reader-based superoxide measurements was confirmed by the inhibition of fluorescence with superoxide dismutase and HPLC analysis. We show that limitations of the HPLC-based analysis can be overcome by the optimized fluorescence spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {We estimate the global rate of biogenic silica production in the ocean to be between 200 and 280 \texttimes{} 1012 mol Si yr-1. The upper limit is derived from information on the primary productivity of the oceans, the relative contribution of diatoms to primary production and diatom Si/C ratios. The lower limit is derived independently using a multi-compartment model of nutrient transport and biogenic particle flux, and field data on the balance between silica production and dissolution in the upper ocean. Our upper limit is 30\textendash 50\% lower than several previous estimates, due to new data indicating lower values for both the relative contribution of diatoms to primary productivity and their Si/C ratios. Globally, at least 50\% of the silica produced by diatoms in the euphotic zone dissolves in the upper 100 m, resulting in an estimated export of 100\textendash 140 \texttimes{} 1012 mol Si yr-l to the deep ocean. Our estimates correspond to a global mean rate of biogenic silica production between 0.6 and 0.8 mol Si m-2 yr-1. Incubation experiments indicate that silica production rates exceed that mean by a factor of 3\textendash 12 in coastal areas and are 2\textendash 4 times less than the global average in the oligotrophic mid-ocean gyres. The mean silica production rate in waters overlying diatomaceous sediments (approximately 10\textendash 12\% of the surface area of the oceans) is 0.7\textendash 1.2 mol Si m-2 yr-1. That rate is only slightly higher than the global average, indicating that the silica produced in those regions is only 10\textendash 25\% of the global total. The estimated production of biogenic silica in surface waters of the mid-ocean gyres is approximately equal to that for all major areas of opal sediment accumulation combined. Regional comparison of silica production and accumulation rates suggests a strongly bimodal character in the efficiency of opal preservation in the sea. In waters overlying diatom-rich sediments 15\textendash 25\% of the silica produced in the surface layer accumulates in the seabed, while virtually none of the silica produced in other areas is preserved. The global burial/production ratio of \texttildelow{} 3\% is a composite of those two very different systems. The mechanisms leading to more efficient opal preservation in regions of silica accumulation are presently unknown, but they have no simple relationship to primary productivity. Regional differences in opal preservation appear to be controlled by factors such as low surface temperature, selective grazing and aggregate formation, which diminish the rate of silica dissolution in surface waters and/or accelerate its transport to the seafloor.},

The present investigation was undertaken with the hypothesis that addition of different substrates (amino acids, carbon sources, vitamins) along with reducing agents may aid in diverting Acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA or fatty acid biosynthesis, under mixotrophic conditions in Chlorella sorokiniana. Preliminary investigations undertaken with two reducing agents individually (sodium thiosulphate and methyl viologen) along with selected substrates revealed the promise of sodium thiosulphate (1\%) in enhancing lipid accumulation significantly. Further, the role of inclusion of twelve substrates and sodium thiosulphate revealed that supplementation with tryptophan (0.1\%) recorded 57.28\% enhancement in lipid productivity on 4th day. Highest values of lipid productivity of 33\% were recorded on 8th day in 0.1\% glucose supplemented medium containing sodium thiosulphate. Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) profiles generated revealed significant reduction in the content of Poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and enhanced Mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (especially oleic acid) in the treatments involving tryptophan, Vitamin B12, sodium pyruvate and glucose. This study reveals the promise of using sodium thiosulphate along with selected substrate for enriching the quality and quantity of lipids, which can be valuable for exploiting algae as a source of biodiesel.},

  abstract = {Chromerida are photoautotrophic alveolates so far only isolated from corals in Australia. It has been shown that these secondary plastid-containing algae are closely related to apicomplexan parasites and share various morphological and molecular characters with both Apicomplexa and Dinophyta. So far, the only known representative of the phylum was Chromera velia. Here we provide a formal description of another chromerid, Vitrella brassicaformis gen. et sp. nov., complemented with a detailed study on its ultrastructure, allowing insight into its life cycle. The novel alga differs significantly from the related chromerid C. velia in life cycle, morphology as well as the plastid genome. Analysis of photosynthetic pigments on the other hand demonstrate that both chromerids lack chlorophyll c, the hallmark of phototrophic chromalveolates. Based on the relatively high divergence between C. velia and V. brassicaformis, we propose their classification into distinct families Chromeraceae and Vitrellaceae. Moreover, we predict a hidden and unexplored diversity of the chromerid algae.},

  abstract = {Chattonella marina, a raphidophycean flagellate, is one of the most toxic red tide phytoplankton and causes severe damage to fish farming. Recent studies demonstrated that Chattonella sp. generates superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (.OH), which may be responsible for the toxicity of C. marina. In this study, we found the other raphidophycean flagellates such as Heterosigma akashiwo, Olisthodiscus luteus, and Fibrocapsa japonica also produce O2- and H2O2 under normal growth condition. Among the flagellate species tested, Chattonella has the highest rates of production of O2- and H2O2 as compared on the basis of cell number. This seems to be partly due to differences in their cell sizes, since Chattonella is larger than other flagellate species. The generation of O2- by these flagellate species was also confirmed by a chemiluminescence assay by using 2-methyl-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin++  +-3-one (MCLA). All these raphidophycean flagellates inhibited the proliferation of a marine bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus, in a flagellates/bacteria co-culture system, and their toxic effects were suppressed by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase. Our results suggest that the generation of reactive oxygen species is a common feature of raphidophycean flagellates.},

  abstract = {The unicellular marine phytoplankton Chattonella marina is known to have toxic effects against various living marine organisms, especially fishes. However, details of the mechanism of the toxicity of this plankton remain obscure. Here we demonstrate the generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals from a red tide unicellular organism, C. marina, by using ESR spectroscopy with the spin traps 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN), and by using the luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence response. The spin-trapping assay revealed productions of spin adduct of superoxide anion (O2-) (DMPO-OOH) and that of hydroxyl radical (.OH) (DMPO-OH) in the algal suspension, which was not observed in the ultrasonic-ruptured suspension. The addition of superoxide dismutase (500 U/ml) almost completely inhibited the formation of both DMPO-OOH and DMPO-OH, and carbon-centered radicals were generated with the disappearance of DMPO-OH after addition of 5\% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 5\% ethanol. Furthermore, the generation of methyl and methoxyl radicals, which are thought to be produced by the reaction of hydroxyl radical and Me2SO under aerobic condition, was identified using spin trapping with a combination of PBN and Me2SO. Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay also supported the above observations. These results clearly indicate that C. marina generates and releases the superoxide radical followed by the production of hydroxyl radical to the surrounding environment. The velocity of superoxide generation by C. marina was about 100 times faster than that by mammalian phagocytes per cell basis. The generation of oxygen radical is suggested to be a pathogenic principle in the toxication of red tide to susceptible aquaculture fishes and may be directly correlated with the coastal pollution by red tide.},

Cellular contents of chlorophyll a and b in Scenedesmus acutus that deteriorated more markedly in mixotroph than those of Chlorella vulgaris could account for these different growth behaviors. In other words, mechanisms relevant to the photosynthesis and the oxidative phosphorylation of glucose seem to function independently with respect to Chlorella Vulugaris.},

  abstract = {Background Diatoms play a great role in carbon fixation with about 20\% of the whole fixation in the world. However, harmful algal bloom as known as red tide is a major problem in environment and fishery industry. Even though intensive studies have been conducted so far, the molecular mechanism behind harmful algal bloom was not fully understood. There are two major diatoms have been sequenced, but more diatoms should be examined at the whole genome level, and evolutionary genome studies were required to understand the landscape of molecular mechanism of the harmful algal bloom. Results Here we sequenced the genome of Skeletonema costatum, which is the dominant diatom in Japan causing a harmful algal bloom, and also performed RNA-sequencing analysis for conditions where harmful algal blooms often occur. As results, we found that both evolutionary genomic and comparative transcriptomic studies revealed genes for oxidative stress response and response to cytokinin is a key for the proliferation of the diatom. Conclusions Diatoms causing harmful algal blooms have gained multi-copy of genes related to oxidative stress response and response to cytokinin and obtained an ability to intensive gene expression at the blooms.

Here, we provide experimental evidence for photochemical formation of NO\textbullet{} in seawater. Photoproduction rates and overall scavenging rate constants were measured by irradiation of surface seawater samples collected from the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. Photoproduction rates of NO\textbullet{} ranged from 8.7 \texttimes{} 10-12 M s-1 to 38.8 \texttimes{} 10-12 M s-1 and scavenging rate constants were 0.05-0.33 s-1. The steady state concentrations of NO\textbullet{} in seawater, which were calculated from the photoproduction rates and scavenging rate constants were in the range 2.4-32 \texttimes{} 10-11 M. Estimation from the scavenging rate constant showed that the NO\textbullet{} lifetime in seawater was a few seconds. Our results indicate that nitrite photolysis plays a crucial role in the formation of NO\textbullet, even though we cannot exclude minor contributions from other sources. Analysis of filtered and unfiltered seawater samples showed no significant difference in NO\textbullet{} photoformation rates, which suggests a negligible contribution of NO\textbullet{} produced by photobiological processes. Using an estimated value of the Henry's law constant (kH {$\approx$} 0.0019 M atm-1), a supersaturation of surface seawater of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude was estimated. On the basis of the average values of the surface seawater concentration and the atmospheric NO\textbullet{} concentration, a sea-to-air NO\textbullet{} flux was estimated.},

Siliceous phytoplankton were scarce in the northern half of the transect and in the south of 57\textdegree S (100\textendash 150 cells L-1), with a strong peak in the vicinity of the Polar Front ({$\sim$}200 000 cells L-1), whereas dinoflagellates were more abundant at the northern stations (up to 24 000 cells L-1). In the south of 50\textdegree S phytoplanktonic cell densities were loosely (but significantly, r = 0.54, P \&lt; 0.01) associated with chlorophyll a, whereas in the north of this latitude, this relationship disappeared (r = 0.018, P \&gt; 0.1). In total, 191 diatoms and 4 silicoflagellates were recorded. Changes in diatom assemblage compositions along the transect allowed identification of five discrete areas: Subtropical (29\textdegree S), Northern Transitional (34\textendash 41\textdegree S), Southern Transitional (43\textendash 48\textdegree S), Subantarctic (49\textendash 54\textdegree S) and Antarctic (55\textendash 59\textdegree S), each characterized by a set of typical species. Diversity changed little with latitude, but numbers of species were higher in the north of 40\textdegree S. Comparison of diatom assemblage makeup in the plankton and in the surface sediments shows very strong disagreements, whereby cold water species are very significantly over-represented in the sedimentary record, suggesting enhanced preservation and strong subsurface equatorward advection of the cold water taxa.},

Microalgae have been investigated as a future feedstock alternative to petroleum but the technology is still expensive and improvements are needed. Reduction in costs might be achieved by increasing algal biomass and lipid productivity. The lipids can be used to produce biofuels such as biodiesel and biojet fuel. The marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata grows well and can accumulate high lipid content. In this study, the effects of static magnetic field stimulation (SMF) of 0 (control), 5, 10 and 15 mT were investigated in terms of growth and biochemical composition of this microalga. In comparison to the control, the cells grown at 10 mT had the highest increase in biomass productivity (45\%) and lipid productivity (57\%) in addition to increase in other co-product yields. Some of the co-products could potentially be used for high value-added applications, thus helping to offset costs even further. The use of magnetic field stimulation on microalgae is a promising technique to enhance growth and productivity, and Nannochloropsis oculata was shown in this study to be a suitable microalgae species to be considered for biodiesel applications.},

The 50 Mbp haploid size of the nuclear genome is nearly double that of model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, but 30\% smaller than closer relative Fragilariopsis cylindrus. Diploid assembly, which was facilitated by low levels of allelic heterozygosity (2.7\%), included 14 candidate chromosome pairs composed of long, syntenic contigs, covering 93\% of the total assembly. Telomeric ends were capped with an unusual 12-mer, G-rich, degenerate repeat sequence. Predicted proteins were highly enriched in strain-specific marker domains associated with cell-surface adhesion, biofilm formation, and raphe system gliding motility. Expanded species-specific families of carbonic anhydrases suggest potential enhancement of carbon concentration efficiency, and duplicated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis pathways across cytosolic and organellar compartments may enhance peak metabolic output, contributing to competitive success over other organisms in mixed cultures. The N. inconspicua genome delivers a robust new reference for future functional and transcriptomic studies to illuminate the physiology of benthic pennate diatoms and harness their unique adaptations to support commercial algae biomass and bioproduct production.},

  abstract = {Marine phytoplankton vary widely in size across taxa, and in cell suspension densities across habitats and growth states. Cell suspension density and total biovolume determine the bulk influence of a phytoplankton community upon its environment. Cell suspension density also determines the intercellular spacings separating phytoplankton cells from each other, or from co-occurring bacterioplankton. Intercellular spacing then determines the mean diffusion paths for exchanges of solutes among co-occurring cells. Marine phytoplankton and bacterioplankton both produce and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), to maintain intracellular ROS homeostasis to support their cellular processes, while limiting damaging reactions. Among ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has relatively low reactivity, long intracellular and extracellular lifetimes, and readily crosses cell membranes. Our objective was to quantify how cells can influence other cells via diffusional interactions, using H2O2 as a case study. To visualize and constrain potentials for cell-to-cell exchanges of H2O2, we simulated the decrease of [H2O2] outwards from representative phytoplankton taxa maintaining internal [H2O2] above representative seawater [H2O2]. [H2O2] gradients outwards from static cell surfaces were dominated by volumetric dilution, with only a negligible influence from decay. The simulated [H2O2] fell to background [H2O2] within \textasciitilde 3.1 \textmu m from a Prochlorococcus cell surface, but extended outwards 90 \textmu m from a diatom cell surface. More rapid decays of other, less stable ROS, would lower these threshold distances. Bacterioplankton lowered simulated local [H2O2] below background only out to 1.2 \textmu m from the surface of a static cell, even though bacterioplankton collectively act to influence seawater ROS. These small diffusional spheres around cells mean that direct cell-to-cell exchange of H2O2 is unlikely in oligotrophic habits with widely spaced, small cells; moderate in eutrophic habits with shorter cell-to-cell spacing; but extensive within phytoplankton colonies.},

As it is harder for larger phytoplankton to get rid of ROS as it does not readily diffuse out of the cell, we investigated whether they would have more ROS detoxification genes, and fewer ROS producing genes. We indeed found a breakpoint at 3{$\mu$}m above which cells carry more genes encoding ROS scavenging. We could not determine whether there is an effect of cell size on the total genetic capacity for ROS production. The number of genes associated with ROS production and scavenging increased with larger genome size, although the slope was smaller than that of gene model size vs. genome size, indicating that less of the genome is allocated to ROS production and scavenging in larger genomes.},

  abstract = {Common problems hindering rapid progress in Plant Sciences include cellular, tissue and whole organism complexity, and notably the high level of genomic redundancy affecting simple genetics in higher plants. The novel model organism Ostreococcus tauri is the smallest free-living eukaryote known to date, and possesses a greatly reduced genome size and cellular complexity1,2, manifested by the presence of just one of most organelles (mitochondrion, chloroplast, golgi stack) per cell, and a genome containing only \textasciitilde 8000 genes. Furthermore, the combination of unicellularity and easy culture provides a platform amenable to chemical biology approaches. Recently, Ostreococcus has been successfully employed to study basic mechanisms underlying circadian timekeeping3-6. Results from this model organism have impacted not only plant science, but also mammalian biology7. This example highlights how rapid experimentation in a simple eukaryote from the green lineage can accelerate research in more complex organisms by generating testable hypotheses using methods technically feasible only in this background of reduced complexity. Knowledge of a genome and the possibility to modify genes are essential tools in any model species. Genomic1, Transcriptomic8, and Proteomic9 information for this species is freely available, whereas the previously reported methods6,10 to genetically transform Ostreococcus are known to few laboratories worldwide. In this article, the experimental methods to genetically transform this novel model organism with an overexpression construct by means of electroporation are outlined in detail, as well as the method of inclusion of transformed cells in low percentage agarose to allow selection of transformed lines originating from a single transformed cell. Following the successful application of Ostreococcus to circadian research, growing interest in Ostreococcus can be expected from diverse research areas within and outside plant sciences, including biotechnological areas. Researchers from a broad range of biological and medical sciences that work on conserved biochemical pathways may consider pursuing research in Ostreococcus, free from the genomic and organismal complexity of larger model species.},

This is the first report of toxicity in P. multiseries from Russian waters.

The Russian isolate had an increasing ability to produce domoic acid over time in culture rather than the usual trend of decreasing toxicity. No domoic acid was detected (-2 ng ml-1) in cultures of P. calliantha and P. multistriata from the same locality. The Russian isolate of P. multiseries produced gametes when mated with the Canadian strains of the opposite mating type, but they never developed into zygotes, auxospores or large initial cells. This suggests that there might be ``cryptic'' species within P. multiseries. However, a comparison of molecular and morphometric data between the Russian and Canadian strains showed that they indeed belong to the same species.},

Tandem duplications play a key role in extending the repertoire of specific gene functions, including light and oxygen sensing, which are probably central for its adaptation to benthic habitats. Genes differentially expressed during interactions with bacteria are strongly conserved in other benthic diatoms while many species-specific genes are strongly upregulated during sexual reproduction.

Imaging of both qP and Fv-;/Fm-; requires measurement of Fo-; (the minimum fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state), which cannot be imaged with existing systems.

South Louisiana crude oil was selected to investigate its effects on population growth, chlorophyll a (Chl a) content, antioxidative defense, and lipid peroxidation, for the marine diatom, Ditylum brightwellii, and the dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa triquetra, in laboratory-based microcosm experiments. The transcript levels of several possible stress-responsive genes in D. brightwellii were also measured. The microalgae were exposed to crude oil for up to 96 h, and Chl a content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), the glutathione pool (GSH and GSSG), and lipid peroxidation content were analyzed. The cell growth of both phytoplankton species was inhibited with increasing crude oil concentrations. Crude oil exposure did not affect Chl a content significantly in cells. SOD activities showed similar responses in both species, being enhanced at 4- and 8-mg/L crude oil exposure. Only H. triquetra demonstrated enhanced activity in GSSG pool and lipid peroxidation at 8-mg/L crude oil exposure, suggesting that phytoplankton species have distinct physiological responses and tolerance levels to crude oil exposure. This study indicated the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in phytoplankton under crude oil exposure; however, the progressive damage in cells is still unknown. Thus, ROS-related damage in nucleic acid, lipids, proteins, and DNA, due to crude oil exposure could be a worthwhile subject of study to better understand crude oil toxicity at the base of the food web.},

An ecotoxicity study was conducted herein to investigate the effects of TiO2 NPs on survival and membrane deformation of algal cells. Five different concentrations of nano-TiO2 particles (1, 10, 50, 100 and 500 mg/L) were prepared in synthetic surface water samples with five different water quality characteristics (pH 6.4\textendash 8.4, hardness 10\textendash 320 mg CaCO3/L, ionic strength 0.2\textendash 8 mM, and alkalinity 10\textendash 245 mg CaCO3/L). Results showed a significant increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of NPs with respect to both NP concentrations and ionic content of the test system. A soft synthetic freshwater system at pH 7.3 {$\pm$} 0.2 appeared to provide the most effective water type, with more than 95\% algal mortality observed at 50, 100 and 500 mg/L NP concentrations. At high exposure concentrations, increased malondialdehyde formations were observed. Moreover, due to membrane deformation, TEM images correlated the uptake of the NPs.},

To evaluate the impact of eutrophication on macrophytobenthos, we compared the seasonal development in macrophytobenthic composition, biomass and production, water column parameters (light, nutrients), phytoplankton biomass and production in one mesotrophic and one eutrophic German coastal lagoon. We hypothesized that light availability is the main driver for primary production, and that net primary production is lower at a higher eutrophication level. In the mesotrophic lagoon, macrophytobenthic biomass was much higher with distinct seasonal succession in species composition. Filamentous algae dominated in spring and late summer and probably caused reduced macrophytobenthic biomass and growth during early summer, thus decreasing vegetation stability. Light attenuation was far higher in the eutrophic lagoon, due to high phytoplankton densities, explaining the low macrophytobenthic biomass and species diversity in every season. Areal net primary production was far lower in the eutrophic lagoon. The ``paradox of enrichment'' hypothesis predicts lower production at higher trophic levels with increased nutrient concentrations. Our results prove for the first time that this hypothesis may be valid already at the primary producer level in coastal lagoons.},

  abstract = {Diatoms have evolved a multitude of morphologies, including highly elongated cells and cell chains. Elongation and chain formation have many possible functions, such as grazing protection or effects on sinking. Here, a model of diffusive and advective nutrient transport is used to predict impacts of cell shape and chain length on potential nutrient supply and uptake in a turbulent environment. Rigid, contiguous, prolate spheroids thereby represent the shapes of simple chains and solitary cells. At scales larger than a few centimeters, turbulent water motions produce a more or less homogeneous nutrient distribution. At the much smaller scale of diatom cells, however, turbulence creates a roughly linear shear and nutrients can locally become strongly depleted because of nutrient uptake by phytoplankton cells. The potential diffusive nutrient supply is greater for elongated than for spherically shaped cells of similar volume but lower for chains than for solitary cells. Although the relative increase in nutrient transport due to turbulence is greater for chains, single cells still enjoy a greater total nutrient supply in turbulent environments. Only chains with specialized structures, such as spaces between the cells, can overcome this disadvantage and even obtain a higher nutrient supply than do solitary cells. The model results are compared to laboratory measurements of nutrient uptake under turbulent conditions and to effects of sinking.},

  abstract = {The smallest known eukaryotes, at {$\approx$}1-{$\mu$}m diameter, are Ostreococcus tauri and related species of marine phytoplankton. The genome of Ostreococcus lucimarinus has been completed and compared with that of O. tauri. This comparison reveals surprising differences across orthologous chromosomes in the two species from highly syntenic chromosomes in most cases to chromosomes with almost no similarity. Species divergence in these phytoplankton is occurring through multiple mechanisms acting differently on different chromosomes and likely including acquisition of new genes through horizontal gene transfer. We speculate that this latter process may be involved in altering the cell-surface characteristics of each species. In addition, the genome of O. lucimarinus provides insights into the unique metal metabolism of these organisms, which are predicted to have a large number of selenocysteine-containing proteins. Selenoenzymes are more catalytically active than similar enzymes lacking selenium, and thus the cell may require less of that protein. As reported here, selenoenzymes, novel fusion proteins, and loss of some major protein families including ones associated with chromatin are likely important adaptations for achieving a small cell size.},

  abstract = {The imposition of environmental stresses on plants brings about disturbance in their metabolism thereby negatively affecting their growth and development and leading to reduction in the productivity. One of the manifestations of abiotic and biotic stress conditions is the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can be hazardous to cells. Therefore, in order to protect themselves against toxic ROS, plant cells employ the anti-oxidant defense system. The ascorbate-glutathione pathway (Halliwell-Asada cycle) is an indispensible component of the ROS homeostasis mechanism of plants. This pathway entails the antioxidant metabolites: ascorbate, glutathione and NADPH along with the enzymes linking them. The ascorbate-glutathione pathway is functional in different subcellular compartments and all the enzymes of this pathway exist as multiple isoforms. The expression of different isoforms of the enzymes of ascorbate-glutathione pathway is developmentally as well as spatially regulated. Moreover, various abiotic and biotic stress conditions modulate the expression of the enzyme- isoforms differently. It is the intricate regulation of expression of different isoforms of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway enzymes that helps in the maintenance of redox balance in plants under various abiotic and biotic stress conditions. The present review provides an insight into the gene families of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway, shedding light on their role in different abiotic and biotic stress conditions as well as in the growth and development of plants.},

However, microbes can also induce coral diseases in response to environmental changes under non-optimal conditions. Therefore, studies of microbial communities are needed to understand the health statuses of corals in response to environmental changes. In this study, we performed 16S rDNA metabarcoding to investigate the bacterial communities in two healthy alcyonacean soft coral species (Sinularia sp. and Litophyton sp.) inhabiting the coast of Weno Island (Chuuk, Micronesia) and in ambient seawater. We identified 18 bacterial phyla, 24 classes, 54 orders, 109 families, and 222 genera associated with the two corals and seawater. The bacterial communities differed in the corals and seawater. The bacterial community in Sinularia sp. was dominated by the genus Spirochaeta in Spirochaetaceae (63.9\% relative abundance), followed by Endozoicomonas (10\%). In Litophyton sp., the bacterial community also contained Spirochaeta (19.5\%) and Endozoicomonas (4.7\%), although Cellvibrionaceae (23.7\%) was dominant and other groups such as Rhizobiales (11.5\%) and Rhodospirillales (8.7\%) were evenly distributed. In ambient seawater, the predominant bacteria were Pelagibacter (29.2\%), Rhodobacteraceae (15.5\%), Prochlorococcus (11.3\%), and Vibrio (5.8\%), which are distinct from the species in the two coral species. The microbial communities between the two alcyonacean soft corals and seawater were different, and the microbial community differences were coral species-specific.},

To investigate the adaptive responses of P. minimum to high light stress, we measured growth rate, and generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in cultures exposed to normal (NL) and high light levels (HL). The results showed that HL (800 \textmu mol m-2 s-1) inhibited growth of P. minimum, with maximal inhibition after 7-9 days. HL also increased the amount of ROS and MDA, suggesting that HL stress leads to oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation in this species. Under HL, we first detected superoxide on day 4 and H2O2 on day 5. We also detected SOD activity on day 5 and CAT activity on day 6. The level of lipid peroxidation, an indicator of cell death, was high on day 8. Addition of diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an NAD(P)H inhibitor, decreased the levels of superoxide generation and lipid peroxidation. Our results indicate that the production of ROS which results from HL stress in P. minimum also induces antioxidative enzymes that counteract oxidative damage and allow P. minimum to survive.},

  abstract = {The minute photosynthetic prokaryote Prochlorococcus, which was discovered about 10 years ago, has proven exceptional from several standpoints. Its tiny size (0.5 to 0.7 {$\mu$}m in diameter) makes it the smallest known photosynthetic organism. Its ubiquity within the 40\textdegree S to 40\textdegree N latitudinal band of oceans and its occurrence at high density from the surface down to depths of 200 m make it presumably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. Prochlorococcus typically divides once a day in the subsurface layer of oligotrophic areas, where it dominates the photosynthetic biomass. It also possesses a remarkable pigment complement which includes divinyl derivatives of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and Chl b, the so-called Chl a2 and Chl b2, and, in some strains, small amounts of a new type of phycoerythrin. Phylogenetically, Prochlorococcus has also proven fascinating. Recent studies suggest that it evolved from an ancestral cyanobacterium by reducing its cell and genome sizes and by recruiting a protein originally synthesized under conditions of iron depletion to build a reduced antenna system as a replacement for large phycobilisomes. Environmental constraints clearly played a predominant role in Prochlorococcus evolution. Its tiny size is an advantage for its adaptation to nutrient-deprived environments. Furthermore, genetically distinct ecotypes, with different antenna systems and ecophysiological characteristics, are present at depth and in surface waters. This vertical species variation has allowed Prochlorococcus to adapt to the natural light gradient occurring in the upper layer of oceans. The present review critically assesses the basic knowledge acquired about Prochlorococcus both in the ocean and in the laboratory.},

For this purpose ancestral bacteria evolved a battery of different heme and non-heme enzymes, among which heme-containing catalase-peroxidases (CP) are one of the most widespread representatives. They are unique since they can follow both H2O2-degrading mechanisms, the catalase activity being clearly dominant. With the fast increasing amount of genomic data available, we were able to perform an extensive search for CP and found almost 300 sequences covering a large range of microorganisms. Most of them were encoded by bacterial genomes, but we could also find some in eukaryotic organisms other than fungi, which has never been shown until now. Our screen also reveals that approximately 60\% of the bacteria do not possess CP genes. Chaotic distribution among species and incongruous phylogenetic reconstruction indicated existence of numerous lateral gene transfers in addition to duplication events and regular speciation. The results obtained show an impressively complex gene transmission pattern, and give some new insights about the role of CP and the origin of life on earth. Finally, we propose for the first time bacterial candidates that may have participated in the transfer of CP from bacteria to eukaryotes.},

Low concentrations of SNP (0.1 \textmu mol L-\,1 for the two food algae and 0.01 \textmu mol L-\,1 for the red tide algae) promoted the growth of microalgae slightly. Different concentrations of exogenous NO could also influence parameters of the carbonate system in the culture media.

  abstract = {This study focuses on the mechanisms for hydrogen peroxide detoxification in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. To gain better understanding of the role of different routes of hydrogen peroxide detoxification, we inactivated tplA (thioredoxin-peroxidase-like), which we recently identified. In addition, we inactivated the gene encoding catalase-peroxidase and examined the ability to detoxify H2O2 and to survive oxidative stress in both of the single mutants and in the double mutant. Surprisingly, we observed that the double mutant survived H2O2 concentrations that the single catalase-peroxidase mutant could not tolerate. This phenotype correlated with an increased ability of the double mutant to detoxify externally added H2O2 compared to the catalase-peroxidase mutant. Therefore, our studies suggested the existence of a hydrogen peroxide detoxification activity in addition to catalase-peroxidase and thioredoxin-peroxidase. The rate of detoxification of externally added H2O2 was similar in the wild-type and the TplA mutant cells, suggesting that, under these conditions, catalase-peroxidase activity was essential for this process and TplA was dispensable. However, during excessive radiation, conditions under which the cell might experience oxidative stress, TplA appears to be essential for growth, and cells lacking it cannot compete with the wild-type strain. Overall, these studies suggested different physiological roles for various cellular hydrogen peroxide detoxification mechanisms in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942.},

PSU size varied among species grown at high light from 380 for Dunaliella euchlora to 915 for Chaetoceros danicus. For most species grown at low light intensity, PSU size increased, while the percentage increase varied among species from 13 to 130\%. No change in PSU size was observed for D. euchlora. Photosynthetic efficiency per chlorophyll a (determined from the initial slope of a curve relating photosynthetic rate to light intensity) varied inversely with PSU size. In contrast, photosynthetic efficiency per P700 was enhanced at larger PSU sizes. Therefore, phytoplankton species with intrinsically large PSU sizes probably respond more readily to the rapid fluctuations in light intensity that such organisms experience in the mixed layer.},

We introduce StringTie, a computational method that applies a network flow algorithm originally developed in optimization theory, together with optional de novo assembly, to assemble these complex data sets into transcripts. When used to analyze both simulated and real data sets, StringTie produces more complete and accurate reconstructions of genes and better estimates of expression levels, compared with other leading transcript assembly programs including Cufflinks, IsoLasso, Scripture and Traph. For example, on 90 million reads from human blood, StringTie correctly assembled 10,990 transcripts, whereas the next best assembly was of 7,187 transcripts by Cufflinks, which is a 53\% increase in transcripts assembled. On a simulated data set, StringTie correctly assembled 7,559 transcripts, which is 20\% more than the 6,310 assembled by Cufflinks.},

Due to its reactive nature and numerous chemical redox processes, H2O2 decomposition has been suggested to occur mainly through abiotic pathways involving various seawater constituents. Its decomposition rates in natural seawater show considerable spatial variability and generally obey first order kinetics with half-lives ranging from less than 10 hours in coastal waters to greater than 120 hours in surface waters of the open ocean. This study demonstrates that hydrogen peroxide decomposition in natural seawater appears primarily to be biologically mediated by microorganisms less than 1{$\mu$}m diameter. Cultured microorganisms added to seawater, especially the prokaryotes Vibrio pelagius and Synechococcus sp. were very efficient mediators of H2O2 decomposition.},

Phosphoglycolate formed by oxygen fixation is recycled to the Calvin cycle intermediate phosphoglycerate in the photorespiratory pathway. This reaction cascade consumes energy and reducing equivalents and part of the afore fixed carbon is again released as CO2. Because of this, photorespiration was often viewed as a wasteful process. Here, we review the current knowledge on the components of the photorespiratory pathway that has been mainly achieved through genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis. Based on this knowledge, the energy costs of photorespiration are calculated, but the numerous positive aspects that challenge the traditional view of photorespiration as a wasteful pathway are also discussed. An outline of possible alternative pathways beside the major pathway is provided. We summarize recent results about photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms expressing a carbon concentrating mechanism and the implications of these results for understanding Arabidopsis photorespiration. Finally, metabolic engineering approaches aiming to improve plant productivity by reducing photorespiratory losses are evaluated.},

Reduction of the E haem promotes Ca2+-dependent spin state and coordination changes at the P haem rendering it accessible to ligand. Recent crystallographic work on the oxidised and mixed valence enzymes has suggested a mechanism by which an electron entering the E haem remotely triggers this activation of the P haem. Binding of hydrogen peroxide at the activated P haem leads to an intermediate catalytic form containing two oxidising equivalents, one of which is a ferryl oxene. This form of the enzyme is then reduced by two single electron transfers to the E haem delivered by small redox proteins such as cytochromes or cupredoxins. The binding of these small redox proteins is dominated by global electrostatic forces but the interfaces of the electron transfer complexes that are formed are largely hydrophobic and relatively non-specific. These features allow very high electron transfer rates in the steady state.},

The latter can be achieved via oxidation to the corresponding aldehydes or ketones. As an alternative to (thermodynamically disfavoured) nicotinamide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, alcohol oxidases make use of molecular oxygen but their application is under-represented in synthetic biotransformations. In this review, the mechanism of copper-containing and flavoprotein alcohol oxidases is discussed in view of their ability to accept electronically activated or non-activated alcohols and their propensity towards over-oxidation of aldehydes yielding carboxylic acids. In order to facilitate the selection of the optimal enzyme for a given biocatalytic application, the substrate tolerance of alcohol oxidases is compiled and discussed: Substrates are classified into groups (non-activated prim- and sec-alcohols; activated allylic, cinnamic and benzylic alcohols; hydroxy acids; sugar alcohols; nucleotide alcohols; sterols) together with suitable alcohol oxidases, their microbial source, relative activities and (stereo)selectivities.},

N. microcephala was grown in three different densities until the stationary growth phase was reached. Throughout the experiment, growth rate was negatively related to cell density. Superoxide dismutase activity, protein thiol, and diatoxanthin concentrations indicated increasing oxidative stress with increasing cell density, which was most probably caused by nutrient depletion of the medium. Pigment contents per cell (except for diatoxanthin) decreased with increasing cell density. N. microcephala was able to synthesize thiamine and its thiamine content per cell increased in concert with cell density. In comparison, the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae was unable to synthesize thiamine. These results suggest that cells of N. microcephala subjected to higher competition and lower growth rates have a lower carotenoid content and a higher thiamine content. If such responses would occur in nature as well, eutrophication (higher cell densities) may alter the quality of microalgae as food items for higher trophic levels not only by species shifts in the phytoplankton, but also by changes in the cellular nutritional value within species. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

They are produced by an expanding variety of anthropogenic sources suggesting an increasingly important role for this form of pollution. The toxic effect of heavy metals appears to be related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the resulting unbalanced cellular redox status. Algae respond to heavy metals by induction of several antioxidants, including diverse enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, and the synthesis of low molecular weight compounds such as carotenoids and glutathione. At high, or acute, levels of metal pollutants, damage to algal cells occurs because ROS levels exceed the capacity of the cell to cope. At lower, or chronic, levels algae accumulate heavy metals and can pass them on to organisms of other trophic levels such as mollusks, crustaceans, and fishes. We review here the evidence linking metal accumulation, cellular toxicity, and the generation of ROS in aquatic environments.},

Marine phytoplankton produce the ROS superoxide (O2-) extracellularly and can be a dominant source of O2- in natural aquatic systems. However, the cellular regulation, biological functioning, and broader ecological impacts of extracellular O2- production by marine phytoplankton remain mysterious. Here, we explored the regulation and potential roles of extracellular O2- production by a noncalcifying strain of the cosmopolitan coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi, a key species of marine phytoplankton that has not been examined for extracellular O2- production previously. Cell-normalized extracellular O2- production was highest under presumably low-stress conditions during active proliferation and inversely related to cell density during exponential phase. Removal of extracellular O2- through addition of the O2- scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD), however, increased growth rates, growth yields, cell biovolume, and photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) indicating an overall physiological improvement. Thus, presence of extracellular O2- does not directly stimulate E. huxleyi proliferation, as previously suggested for other phytoplankton, bacteria, fungi, and protists. Extracellular O2- production decreased in the dark, suggesting a connection with photosynthetic processes. Taken together, the tight regulation of this stress independent production of extracellular O2- by E. huxleyi suggests that it could be involved in fundamental photophysiological processes.},

A dilute solution of five NO molecules (mole fraction 0.018) and 280 H2O molecules (mole fraction 0.982) has been taken as the sample. The self-diffusion coefficient of the solvent is calculated by using mean square displacement (MSD) where as that for solute (NO) is calculated by using MSD and velocity auto-correlation function (VACF). The results are then compared with the available experimental values. The results from the present work for water come in good agreement, very precise at low temperatures, with the experimental values. The diffusion coefficients of NO, on the other hands, agree well with the available theoretical studies, and also with experiment at low temperatures (up to 310 K). The results at the higher temperatures (up to 333 K), however, deviate significantly with the experimental observations. Also, the mutual diffusion coefficients of NO in water have been calculated by using Darken's relation.

Within cultures growing diazotrophically, distinct subpopulations were detected that fixed N               2               at night or in the morning. Additional significant within-population heterogeneity was likely caused by differences in the relative amounts of N assimilated into cyanophycin from sources external and internal to the cells.

N assimilation in cells growing on NO               3               switched from cyanophycin synthesis to protein synthesis, suggesting that once a cyanophycin quota is met, it is bypassed in favor of protein synthesis.

It is estimated that the low surface chlorophyll areas in these oceans combined have expanded by 6.6 million km2 or by about 15.0\% from 1998 through 2006. In both hemispheres, evidence shows a more rapid expansion of the low surface chlorophyll waters during the winter. The North Atlantic, which has the smallest oligotrophic gyre is expanding most rapidly, both annually at 4.3\%/yr and seasonally, in the first quarter at 8.5\%/yr. Mean sea surface temperature in each of these 4 subtropical gyres also increased over the 9-year period.

  abstract = {Cysteine is one of the least abundant amino acids, yet it is frequently found as a highly conserved residue within functional (regulatory, catalytic or binding) sites in proteins. It is the unique chemistry of the thiol or thiolate group of cysteine that imparts functional sites with their specialized properties (e.g., nucleophilicity, high affinity metal binding, and/or ability to form disulfide bonds). Highlighted in this review are some of the basic biophysical and biochemical properties of cysteine groups and the equations that apply to them, particularly with respect to pKa and redox potential. Also summarized are the types of low molecular weight thiols present in high concentrations in most cells, as well as the ways in which modifications of cysteinyl residues can impart or regulate molecular functions important to cellular processes including signal transduction.},

The conversion of excitation energy absorbed by chlorophylls into the energy of separated charges and subsequent water\textendash plastoquinone oxidoreductase activity are inadvertently coupled with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Singlet oxygen is generated by the excitation energy transfer from triplet chlorophyll formed by the intersystem crossing from singlet chlorophyll and the charge recombination of separated charges in the PSII antenna complex and reaction center of PSII, respectively. Apart to the energy transfer, the electron transport associated with the reduction of plastoquinone and the oxidation of water is linked to the formation of superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. To protect PSII pigments, proteins and lipids against the oxidative damage, PSII evolved a highly efficient antioxidant defense system comprising either a non-enzymatic (prenyllipids such as carotenoids and prenylquinols) or an enzymatic (superoxide dismutase and catalase) scavengers. It is pointed out here that both the formation and the scavenging of ROS are controlled by the energy level and the redox potential of the excitation energy transfer and the electron transport carries, respectively. The review is focused on the mechanistic aspects of ROS production and scavenging by PSII. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosystem II.},

Electron transport across the thylakoid membrane terminated by NADPH and ATP formation is inadvertently coupled with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reactive oxygen species are mainly produced by photosystem I; however, under certain circumstances, PSII contributes to the overall formation of ROS in the thylakoid membrane. Under limitation of electron transport reaction between both photosystems, photoreduction of molecular oxygen by the reducing side of PSII generates a superoxide anion radical, its dismutation to hydrogen peroxide and the subsequent formation of a hydroxyl radical terminates the overall process of ROS formation on the PSII electron acceptor side. On the PSII electron donor side, partial or complete inhibition of enzymatic activity of the water-splitting manganese complex is coupled with incomplete oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide. The review points out the mechanistic aspects in the production of ROS on both the electron acceptor and electron donor side of PSII.},

A large pigment\textendash protein complex, PSII, known to serve as a water-plastoquinone oxidoreductase, contains three metal centers comprising non-heme iron, heme iron of Cyt b559 and the water-splitting manganese complex. Metal ions bound to PSII proteins maintain the electron transport from water to plastoquinone and regulate the pro-oxidant and antioxidant activity in PSII. In this review, attention is focused on the role of PSII metal centers in (i) the formation of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals by sequential one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen and the formation of hydrogen peroxide by incomplete two-electron oxidation of water; and (ii) the elimination of superoxide anion radical by one-electron oxidation and reduction (superoxide dismutase activity) and of hydrogen peroxide by two-electron oxidation and reduction (catalase activity). The balance between the formation and elimination of reactive oxygen species by PSII metal centers is discussed as an important aspect in the prevention of photo-oxidative damage of PSII proteins and lipids.},

Physiologically and genetically distinct P. marinus isolates from many oceans in the world were assigned two different groups, a tightly clustered high-light (HL)-adapted and a divergent low-light (LL-) adapted clade. Phylogenetic analysis of this cyanobacterium on the basis of 16S rRNA and other conserved genes did not show consistency with its phenotypic behavior. We analyzed phylogeny of this genus on the basis of complete genome sequences through genome alignment, overlapping-gene content and gene-order approach. Phylogenetic tree of P. marinus obtained by comparing whole genome sequences in contrast to that based on 16S rRNA gene, corresponded well with the HL/LL ecotypic distinction of twelve strains and showed consistency with phenotypic classification of P. marinus. Evidence for the horizontal descent and acquisition of genes within and across the genus was observed. Many genes involved in metabolic functions were found to be conserved across these genomes and many were continuously gained by different strains as per their needs during the course of their evolution. Consistency in the physiological and genetic phylogeny based on whole genome sequence is established. These observations improve our understanding about the adaptation and diversification of these organisms under evolutionary pressure.},

Sequenceserver substantially increases the efficiency of researchers working with sequence data. This is due to innovations at three levels. First, our software can be installed and used on custom datasets extremely rapidly for personal and shared applications. Second, based on analysis of user input and simple algorithms, Sequenceserver reduces the amount of decisions the user must make, provides interactive visual feedback, and prevents common potential errors that would otherwise cause erroneous results. Finally, Sequenceserver provides multiple highly visual and text-based output options that mirror the requirements and work patterns of researchers. Together, these features greatly facilitate BLAST analysis and interpretation and thus substantially enhance researcher productivity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Low molecular weight carboxylic acids could not account for most of the observed sunlight and hydroxyl-induced increases in DOM bioavailability. Both sunlight and hydroxyl-mediated reactions significantly decreased the bacterial growth efficiency of DOM, indicating that photochemical reactions affect not only the fraction of the total DOM pool available to bacteria on ecologically relevant timescales but also the substrate quality and ultimately the environmental fate of this material.

The constitutive and induced Cpx1 transcripts have the same half-lives in vivo, and all encode the same polypeptide with a chloroplast-targeting transit sequence, but the shortest one representing the induced form is a 2\textendash 4-fold better template for translation than are either of the constitutive forms. The enzyme remains localized to a soluble compartment in the chloroplast even in induced cells, and its abundance is not affected when the tetrapyrrole pathway is manipulated either genetically or by gabaculine treatment.},

  abstract = {Inland waters cover about 2.5 percent of our planet and harbor huge numbers of known and unknown microorganisms including viruses. Viruses likely play dynamic, albeit largely undocumented roles in regulating microbial communities and in recycling nutrients in the ecosystem. Phycodnaviruses are a genetically diverse, yet morphologically similar, group of large dsDNA-containing viruses (160- to 560-kb) that inhabit aquatic environments. Members of the genus Chlorovirus are common in freshwater. They replicate in eukaryotic, single-celled, chlorella-like green algae that normally exist as endosymbionts of protists in nature. Very little is known about the natural history of the chloroviruses and how they achieve high-titer and long-term persistence in nature. To study their natural history, we examined chloroviruses over a three-year period to determine their abundance, prevalence, and genetic diversity in a small lake in Nebraska (Chapter II). These studies indicated that the amount of infectious virus particles was seasonal and both host- and site-dependent. Chlorovirus populations persisted year-round, suggesting that the viruses are either very stable or that viral production occurs in an unknown natural host(s). During this study, a new viral group was discovered and characterized, expanding the Chlorovirus genus (Chapter III). This group, designated as Only Syngen viruses (OSy), replicates in Chlorella variabilis (Syngen 2-3) cells. Furthermore, OSy viruses also have non-permissive features in two phylogenetically related C. variabilis sub-species and constitute the first report of a post-infection host mechanism that results in resistance against infection. In Chapter IV, five symbiotic-virus suceptible and four free-living Chlorella species were evaluated for their capabilities to assimilate nutrients. Hierarchical clustering reveals a clear distinction of both groups based on their assimilation of galactose, nitrate, asparagine, proline, and serine. Additionally, genomic and differential expression analyses of symbiotic algae confirm an abundance of amino acid transporter genes, some of which are constitutively expressed when the symbiotic algae either grow axenically or as an endosymbiont within their host. Such similarities indicate a parallel coevolution of shared metabolic pathways across multiple independent symbiotic events and suggest that physiological changes driving the Chlorella symbiotic phenotype also contribute to their natural fitness.},

The unicellular, diazotrophic cyanobacterium Cyanothece is widely found in coastal, subtropical oceans. We analyze the consequences of diazotrophy on growth efficiency, compared to NO3--supported growth in Cyanothece, to understand how cells cope with N2-fixation when they also have to face carbon limitation, which may transiently affect populations in coastal environments or during blooms of phytoplankton communities. When grown in obligate diazotrophy, cells face the double burden of a more ATP-demanding N-acquisition mode and additional metabolic losses imposed by the transient storage of reducing potential as carbohydrate, compared to a hypothetical N2 assimilation directly driven by photosynthetic electron transport. Further, this energetic burden imposed by N2-fixation could not be alleviated, despite the high irradiance level within the cultures, because photosynthesis was limited by the availability of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and possibly by a constrained capacity for carbon storage. DIC limitation exacerbates the costs on growth imposed by nitrogen fixation. Therefore, the competitive efficiency of diazotrophs could be hindered in areas with insufficient renewal of dissolved gases and/or with intense},

  abstract = {Glycolate oxidase knockouts in Cyanidioschyzon reveal that red algae harbour a plant-like photorespiratory pathway. This suggests that a photorespiratory pathway employing peroxisomal glycolate oxidase is ancient and not recently evolved., Photorespiration is essential for all organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis. The evolution of photorespiratory metabolism began among cyanobacteria and led to a highly compartmented pathway in plants. A molecular understanding of photorespiration in eukaryotic algae, such as glaucophytes, rhodophytes, and chlorophytes, is essential to unravel the evolution of this pathway. However, mechanistic detail of the photorespiratory pathway in red algae is scarce. The unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae represents a model for the red lineage. Its genome is fully sequenced, and tools for targeted gene engineering are available. To study the function and importance of photorespiration in red algae, we chose glycolate oxidase (GOX) as the target. GOX catalyses the conversion of glycolate into glyoxylate, while hydrogen peroxide is generated as a side-product. The function of the candidate GOX from C. merolae was verified by the fact that recombinant GOX preferred glycolate over L-lactate as a substrate. Yellow fluorescent protein-GOX fusion proteins showed that GOX is targeted to peroxisomes in C. merolae. The GOX knockout mutant lines showed a high-carbon-requiring phenotype with decreased growth and reduced photosynthetic activity compared to the wild type under ambient air conditions. Metabolite analyses revealed glycolate and glycine accumulation in the mutant cells after a shift from high CO2 conditions to ambient air. In summary, or results demonstrate that photorespiratory metabolism is essential for red algae. The use of a peroxisomal GOX points to a high photorespiratory flux as an ancestral feature of all photosynthetic eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Redox degenerative reactions of the biological system inevitably produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their derivatives. Oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance in pro-oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis that leads to the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, organic hydro peroxides, nitric oxide, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals etc. Information are accumulating steadily, supporting the general importance of oxidative damage of tissue and cellular components as a primary or secondary causative factor in many different human diseases and aging processes. Many of the recent landmarks in scientific research have shown that in human beings, oxidative stress has been implicated in the progression of major health problems by inactivating the metabolic enzymes and damaging important cellular components, oxidizing the nucleic acids, leading to cardiovascular diseases, eye disorders, joint disorders, neurological diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), atherosclerosis, lung and kidney disorders, liver and pancreatic diseases, cancer, ageing, disease of the reproductive system including the male and female infertility etc. The advent of a growing number of in vitro and in vivo models for evaluating the human disease pathology is aiding scientists in deciphering the detailed mechanisms of the point of intersection of the oxidative stress with other cellular components or events in the growing roadmap leading to different human disorders. The toxic effect of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in human is balanced by the antioxidant action of non-enzymatic antioxidants, as well as by antioxidant enzymes. Such antioxidant defences are extremely important as they represent the direct removal of free radicals (prooxidants), thus providing maximal protection for biological sites. These systems not only assert with the problem of oxidative damage, but also play a crucial role in wellness, health maintenance, and prevention of chronic and degenerative diseases. In this review we have tried to generate a gross picture on the critical role of ROS in deteriorating human health and the importance of antioxidative defense system in ameliorating the toxicity of ROS.},

Here, we show that leaf carotenoids are also able to quench 1O2 by a chemical mechanism involving their oxidation. In vitro oxidation of {$\beta$}-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin by 1O2 generated various aldehydes and endoperoxides. A search for those molecules in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves revealed the presence of 1O2-specific endoperoxides in low-light-grown plants, indicating chronic oxidation of carotenoids by 1O2. {$\beta$}-Carotene endoperoxide, but not xanthophyll endoperoxide, rapidly accumulated during high-light stress, and this accumulation was correlated with the extent of photosystem (PS) II photoinhibition and the expression of various 1O2 marker genes. The selective accumulation of {$\beta$}-carotene endoperoxide points at the PSII reaction centers, rather than the PSII chlorophyll antennae, as a major site of 1O2 accumulation in plants under high-light stress. {$\beta$}-Carotene endoperoxide was found to have a relatively fast turnover, decaying in the dark with a half time of about 6 h. This carotenoid metabolite provides an early index of 1O2 production in leaves, the occurrence of which precedes the accumulation of fatty acid oxidation products.},

Using a multi-seasonal, low trophic state mesocosm experiment, we investigated how higher water temperature and brownification affect plankton community composition, phenology, and functioning. We tested the hypothesis that higher water temperature (+3\textdegree C) and brownification will, a) cause plankton community composition to shift toward small sized phytoplankton and cyanobacteria, and, b) extend the length of the growing season entailing higher phytoplankton production later in the season. We demonstrate that the 3\textdegree C increase of water temperature favored the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and small sized autotrophic picophytoplankton cells with significantly higher primary production during warmer fall periods. However, 3X darker water (effect of brownification) caused no significant changes in the plankton community composition or functioning relative to control conditions. Our findings reveal that increased temperature change plankton community structure by favoring smaller sized species proliferation (autotrophic phytoplankton and small size cladocerans), and increase primary productivity and community turnover. Finally, results of this multi-seasonal experiment suggest that warming by 3\textdegree C in aquatic ecosystems of low trophic state may cause planktonic food web functioning to become more dominated by fast growing, r-trait species (i.e., small sizes and rapid development).},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated during mitochondrial oxidative metabolism as well as in cellular response to xenobiotics, cytokines, and bacterial invasion. Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance due to excess ROS or oxidants over the capability of the cell to mount an effective antioxidant response. Oxidative stress results in macromolecular damage and is implicated in various disease states such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging. Paradoxically, accumulating evidence indicates that ROS also serve as critical signaling molecules in cell proliferation and survival. While there is a large body of research demonstrating the general effect of oxidative stress on signaling pathways, less is known about the initial and direct regulation of signaling molecules by ROS, or what we term the ``oxidative interface.'' Cellular ROS sensing and metabolism are tightly regulated by a variety of proteins involved in the redox (reduction/oxidation) mechanism. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms through which ROS directly interact with critical signaling molecules to initiate signaling in a broad variety of cellular processes, such as proliferation and survival (MAP kinases, PI3 kinase, PTEN, and protein tyrosine phosphatases), ROS homeostasis and antioxidant gene regulation (thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, Ref-1, and Nrf-2), mitochondrial oxidative stress, apoptosis, and aging (p66Shc), iron homeostasis through iron\textendash sulfur cluster proteins (IRE\textendash IRP), and ATM-regulated DNA damage response.},

  abstract = {Coccolithophores have influenced the global climate for over 200 million years1. These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of total carbon fixation in some systems2. They form blooms that can occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and are distinguished by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate exoskeletons (coccoliths), rendering them visible from space3. Although coccolithophores export carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the sea floor, they also release CO2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO2 production or uptake, sequestration and export to the deep ocean4. Here we report the first haptophyte reference genome, from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and sequences from 13 additional isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core genes plus genes distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an atypical complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a single species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoires. Genome variability within this species complex seems to underpin its capacity both to thrive in habitats ranging from the equator to the subarctic and to form large-scale episodic blooms under a wide variety of environmental conditions.},

Proline has been shown to provide protection against various reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. On the other hand, its protective effect against singlet oxygen has been debated, and it is considered ineffective against superoxide. Here we used various methods for the detection of singlet oxygen (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, spin trapping by 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone, fluorescence probing by singlet oxygen sensor green, SOSG, and oxygen uptake due to chemical trapping) and superoxide (oxygen uptake due to oxygen reduction) in vitro and in isolated thylakoids. We demonstrated that proline does quench both singlet oxygen and superoxide in vitro. By comparing the effects of chemical scavengers and physical quenchers, we concluded that proline eliminates singlet oxygen via a physical mechanism, with a bimolecular quenching rate of ca. 1.5\textendash 4 106 M-1 s-1. Our data also show that proline can eliminate superoxide in vitro in a process that is likely to proceed via an electron transfer reaction. We could also show that proline does quench both singlet oxygen and superoxide produced in isolated thylakoids. The scavenging efficiency of proline is relatively small on a molar basis, but considering its presence in high amounts in plant cells under stress conditions it may provide a physiologically relevant contribution to ROS scavenging, supplementing other nonenzymatic ROS scavengers of plant cells.},

In a combined approach utilizing differential electrochemical mass spectrometry in a generator\textendash collector arrangement as well as classical electrochemical techniques, the reversible formation of insoluble peroxide as well as of slightly soluble superoxide is shown. As opposed to other peroxides in other non-aqueous metal\textendash oxygen systems, potassium peroxide can be reoxidized to superoxide with an overpotential of as little as 100 mV. The investigation of the effect of the oxygen partial pressure between 0 and 1 atmosphere demonstrates how the precipitation of superoxide increases the oxidation overpotential of the peroxide and establishes a link between this work and other studies, in which the reversibility of the peroxide formation has not been identified.},

  abstract = {Diverse studies of plastid data suggest that the photosynthetic organelles of red algae, viridiplants, and glaucophytes, the three lineages comprising the Archaeplastida supergroup, share a common ancestor. Glaucophyte plastids are unique among archaeplastidians due to the presence of a vestigial peptidoglycan wall and the accumulation of RuBisCO in the stroma that resembles cyanobacterial carboxysomes. These ancestral traits, typically observed in cyanobacteria, have led to suggestions that glaucophytes are the earliest branching Archaeplastida lineage. Plastid phylogenomic surveys recover Glaucophyta as the earliest-diverging branch, but tree topology tests have not rejected the placement of red algae or viridiplants as the first splitting group. Resolving the branching history of the primary plastids might rely on both the implementation of phylogenetic methods that cope better with systematic errors and further expansion of the taxonomic sampling. The paucity of the Glaucophyta genome data has been a limitation when contrasting different hypotheses about the diversification of the Archaeplastida. The plastome of Cyanophora paradoxa was the only available from Glaucophyta for almost 20 years, until recently when plastomes of Glaucocystis, Cyanoptyche, and Gloeochaete and other Cyanophora species were sequenced. Comparative analyses show that the plastid gene repertoire of glaucophytes is highly conserved, and that the size and gene content of their plastomes do not differ drastically from those of other archaeplastidians. In fact, in terms of gene content, red algal plastomes are likely more similar to the repertoire of the ancestral primary plastid. Studies of plastomes have expanded our perspective about the diversity within Glaucophyta, but such studies are still based on limited taxonomic samples. The further inclusion of data from novel glaucophyte taxa will be critical to obtain more solid answers about the evolution and diversity of these rare algae.},

  abstract = {Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) contain an active site cysteine that is sensitive to oxidation by H2O2. Mammalian cells express six Prx isoforms that are localized to various cellular compartments. The oxidized active site cysteine of Prx can be reduced by a cellular thiol, thus enabling Prx to function as a locally constrained peroxidase. Regulation of Prx via phosphorylation in response to extracellular signals allows the local accumulation of H2O2 and thereby enables its messenger function. The fact that the oxidation state of the active site cysteine of Prx can be transferred to other proteins that are less intrinsically susceptible to H2O2 also allows Prx to function as an H2O2 sensor.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Massive phytoplankton blooms develop at the Arctic ice edge, sometimes extending far under the pack ice. An extensive culturing effort was conducted before and during a phytoplankton bloom in Baffin Bay between April and July 2016. Different isolation strategies were applied, including flow cytometry cell sorting, manual single cell pipetting and serial dilution. Although all three techniques yielded the most common organisms, each technique retrieved specific taxa, highlighting the importance of using several methods to maximize the number and diversity of isolated strains. More than 1,000 cultures were obtained, characterized by 18S rRNA sequencing and optical microscopy and de-replicated to a subset of 276 strains presented in this work. Strains grouped into 57 genotypes defined by 100\% 18S rRNA sequence similarity. These genotypes spread across five divisions: Heterokontophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Haptophyta and Dinophyta. Diatoms were the most abundant group (193 strains), mostly represented by the genera \emph{Chaetoceros} and \emph{Attheya}. The genera \emph{Rhodomonas} and \emph{Pyramimonas} were the most abundant non-diatom nanoplankton strains, while \emph{Micromonas polaris} dominated the picoplankton. Diversity at the class level was higher during the peak of the bloom. Potentially new species were isolated, in particular within the genera \emph{Navicula}, \emph{Nitzschia}, \emph{Coscinodiscus}, \emph{Thalassiosira}, \emph{Pyramimonas}, \emph{Mantoniella} and \emph{Isochrysis}.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Submitted to: Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene Date: May 17, 2019{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Just as hydrogen peroxide was once considered to be simply a deleterious by-product of oxidative metabolism but is now acknowledged to have signalling roles in plant cells, so evidence is mounting for the hydroxyl radical as being more than merely an agent of destruction. Its oxidative power is harnessed to facilitate germination, growth, stomatal closure, reproduction, the immune response, and adaptation to stress. It features in plant cell death and is a key tool in microbial degradation of plant matter for recycling. Production of the hydroxyl radical in the wall, at the plasma membrane, and intracellularly is facilitated by a range of peroxidases, superoxide dismutases, NADPH oxidases, and transition metal catalysts. The spatio-temporal activity of these must be tightly regulated to target substrates precisely to the site of radical production, both to prevent damage and to accommodate the short half life and diffusive capacity of the hydroxyl radical. Whilst research has focussed mainly on the hydroxyl radical's mode of action in wall loosening, studies now extend to elucidating which proteins are targets in signalling systems. Despite the difficulties in detecting and manipulating this ROS, there is sufficient evidence now to acknowledge the hydroxyl radical as a potent regulator in plant cell biology.},

Microscopic observations of live material were compared to physical-optical water-column structure, currents and wind. At the start of the study, dense concentrations of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were observed directly at the surface. Optical profiles indicated that most cells were concentrated in a thin layer at \textasciitilde 5 m depth, which appeared to be contiguous throughout the sound. Several days later, sustained winds forced a plume of lighter water over the surface of the sound, displacing the original water mass, with its entrained flora, to depth. The resulting near-bottom thin layer persisted for several days, and contained {$>$}106 Pseudonitzschia spp. cells l\textendash 1. Microscopic examination of live cells from the deep layer revealed that colonies were alive and motile. In 1996 and again in 1998, we observed P. pseudodelicatissima living within colonies of Chaetoceros socialis. Water-column thin layers, near-bottom thin layers and populations of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. within C. socialis colonies could easily escape detection by routine monitoring procedures, and may be a potential source of unexplained toxicity events.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

The pelagic waters of the Levantine Basin of the eastern Mediterranea Sea are among the most oligotrophic on record. We surveyed the spatial distribution of bacterial ab dance, biomass and production along 2 transects of the pelagic waters of the southern Levantine Ba to assess which changes in these parameters may occur in association with varying physical structu and chlorophyll concentrations, to calculate the relative biomass contributions of bacteria and phyto plankton, and to estimate the magnitude of carbon flux from phytoplankton to bacteria. Chloroph had an average concentration of 134 {$\pm$} 85.4 ng L1 and was relatively uniform throughout the uppe 200 m. Bacterial numbers ranged from 0.40 to 3.90 x 108 cells T1 and were generally highest abov 110 m. Cocci cells comprised 87\% of the population with an average volume of 0.049 pm3. Bacteria numbers and biomass were notably high in the Ierapetra Eddy and Mersa Matruh Gyre. Although b terial numbers and chlorophyll concentrations were not generally correlated, the mean bacterial num ber was accurately predicted from a regression equation using chlorophyll. Over the upper 200 m, terial biomass (x= 603 mgC m\textasciitilde 2) was on average about 50\% of phytoplankton biomass (x= 1235 mg m"2), which is contrary to other published studies reporting bacterial biomass equalled or exceede algal biomass in oligotrophic marine waters.

  abstract = {The genus Synechococcus (cyanobacteria), while containing morphologically similar isolates, is polyphyletic and organisms presently classified as such require reclassification into several independent genera. Studies based on analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences have shown that members of the genus Synechococcus are affiliated to three of seven deeply branching cyanobacterial lineages. In addition, some strains do not appear to be associated with any of these lineages and may represent novel clades. In this report, a cyanobacterial phylogeny based on 16S rDNA sequences, including 14 newly sequenced Synechococcus isolates, is presented. One newly sequenced Synechococcus strain (PCC 7902) did not have any close relatives amongst cyanobacterial isolates currently contained in 16S rDNA sequence databases and was only loosely affiliated to a cyanobacterial lineage in which no other Synechococcus strains were found. Three hot-spring Synechococcus isolates, including two that were newly sequenced in this study (PCC 6716 and PCC 6717), formed an additional cyanobacterial lineage. These results indicated that Synechococcus species are affiliated to five of eight deeply branching cyanobacterial lineages. Part of the phycocyanin (PC) gene sequence (cpc), including the intergenic spacer (IGS) between cpcB and cpcA and the corresponding flanking regions (cpcBA-IGS), was used to investigate relationships between closely related Synechococcus isolates. Previously described PCR primers did not amplify this region from the majority of strains under investigation, so a new set of primers was designed that allowed amplification and sequencing of the cpcBAIGS and flanking regions from 38 Synechococcus species. Phylogenetic analysis of this region was largely consistent with that obtained from 16S rDNA sequence analysis and revealed a relationship between the primary PC DNA sequence and the phycobilin content of cells.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.},

It numerically dominates the phytoplankton in the tropical and subtropical oceans, and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis. Here we compare the genomes of two Prochlorococcus strains that span the largest evolutionary distance within the Prochlorococcus lineage and that have different minimum, maximum and optimal light intensities for growth. The high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome (1,657,990 base pairs, 1,716 genes) of any known oxygenic phototroph, whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger, at 2,410,873 base pairs (2,275 genes). The comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures. Although the two strains have 1,350 genes in common, a significant number are not shared, and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor, or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer. Some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables, and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans.},

Each strain examined yielded one ITS sequence that contained two tRNA genes. Dramatic variations in the length and G+C content of the spacer were observed among the strains, particularly among Prochlorococcus strains. Secondary-structure models of the ITS were predicted in order to facilitate alignment of the sequences for phylogenetic analyses. The previously observed division of Prochlorococcus into two ecotypes (called high and low-B/A after their differences in chlorophyll content) were supported, as was the subdivision of the high-B/A ecotype into four genetically distinct clades. ITS-based phylogenies partitioned marine cluster A Synechococcus into six clades, three of which can be associated with a particular phenotype (motility, chromatic adaptation, and lack of phycourobilin). The pattern of sequence divergence within and between clades is suggestive of a mode of evolution driven by adaptive sweeps and implies that each clade represents an ecologically distinct population. Furthermore, many of the clades consist of strains isolated from disparate regions of the world's oceans, implying that they are geographically widely distributed. These results provide further evidence that natural populations of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus consist of multiple coexisting ecotypes, genetically closely related but physiologically distinct, which may vary in relative abundance with changing environmental conditions.},

This study reports the results of an intercomparison of two methods to measure particle-generated [O2-] in seawater samples, as well as measurements of particle-generated O2- and H2O2 concentrations, decay kinetics, and dark production rates in seawater samples at Station ALOHA and (O2- only) in the southern California Current Ecosystem. O2- was measured using two different methods relying on chemiluminescence detection. The first method measured the difference between steady-state [O2-] in filtered and unfiltered seawater, while the second method (standard method) measured O2- decay to baseline in freshly filtered seawater. Because both methods detected [O2-] relative to the background signal from filtered seawater, both should have measured [O2-] generated by particles (presumably biota). However, the O2- concentrations determined by the first method were always much smaller than those obtained from the second (standard) method. Follow-up laboratory and field experiments showed that the increased signal in the standard method was due to a filtration artifact that could neither be eliminated nor consistently accounted for under the tested conditions. We therefore recommend the first method for measuring particle-generated [O2-]. Measured by this method, Station ALOHA had particle-generated O2- concentrations that ranged from undetectable to 0.02nM, with production rates less than 0.6nMhr-1 and decay rate coefficients from 0.003 to 0.014s-1. The southern California Current Ecosystem had particle-generated O2- concentrations that ranged from undetectable to 0.05nM, with production rates up to 4.7nMhr-1 and decay rate coefficients from 0.006 to 0.017s-1. H2O2 concentrations were measured by chemiluminescence detection, using dark incubations of unfiltered water samples to simultaneously determine production and decay rates. H2O2 concentrations at Station ALOHA ranged from 7 to 88nM. Dark production rates and decay rate coefficients were low (mostly {$<$}1.5nMhr-1 and {$<$}0.03h-1, respectively); higher values were detected when biota were pre-concentrated with net tows. These rates of ROS production are lower than those reported by previous studies in other regions of the Pacific Ocean, but could still be significant compared to photochemical production.},

This study investigated the iron uptake mechanisms that the model organism T. erythraeum IMS101 uses to acquire iron from inorganic iron and iron associated with the weak ligand complex, ferric citrate. IMS101 was observed to employ two different iron uptake mechanisms: superoxide-mediated reduction of inorganic iron in the surrounding milieu and a superoxide-independent uptake system for ferric citrate complexes. While the detailed pathway of ferric citrate utilization remains to be elucidated, transport of iron from this complex appears to involve reduction and/or exchange of the iron out of the complex prior to uptake, either at the outer membrane of the cell or within the periplasmic space. Various iron uptake strategies may allow Trichodesmium to effectively scavenge iron in oligotrophic ocean environments.},

Only four mutually independent Chl FPs, calculated from values of five essential Chl fluorescence (ChlF) yields, are distinguished as the basic ones. These are: the maximum quantum yield of PS2 photochemistry ({$\Phi$}PO), the photochemical quenching of variable ChlF (qP), the non-photochemical quenching of variable ChlF (qN), and the relative change of minimum ChlF (qO). {$\Phi$}PO refers to the dark-adapted state of a thylakoid membrane, qP, qN and qO characterise the light-adapted state. It is demonstrated that all other Chl FPs can be determined using this quartet of parameters. Moreover, three FPs related to the non-radiative energy dissipation within thylakoid membranes are evaluated, namely: the non-photochemical ChlF quenching (NPQ), the complete non-photochemical quenching of ChlF (qCN), and the effective quantum yield of non-photochemical processes in PS2 ({$\Phi$}N). New FPs, the total quenching of variable ChlF (qTV) and the absolute quenching of ChlF (qA) which allow to quantify co-action of the photochemical and non-photochemical processes during a light period are defined and analysed. The interpretation of Chl FPs and recommendations for their application in the photosynthesis research are also given.

Here we show that there is no additive effect of disease symptoms or bacterial growth in the AtrbohD x Atgox1 and AtrbohD x Atgox3 double mutants when compared with individual mutants. Slight additive effect observed previously upon silencing of AtRBOHD in Atgox1 and Atgox3 mutants was most likely due to cross-silencing of AtRBOHF.

Both weak and strong relationships between these 2 microbial groups have been reported for temperate ecosystems. However, data from the tropics and sub-tropics are still scarce, and no consistent pattern regarding the structural microbial connections in these aquatic environments is known so far. We examined bacteria-phytoplankton abundance relationships for tropical freshwaters in comparison to well-studied temperate aquatic ecosystems. We present data on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton abundances in a large data set (1644 samples; lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) from sampling throughout an extensive gradient of latitude (3\textdegree{} N to 33\textdegree{} S) and longitude (35\textdegree{} to 70\textdegree{} W) in tropical waters. We found a generally weak, but significant, relationship between bacterioplankton and phytoplankton abundances and between bacterioplankton and chlorophyll. However, analyzing system by system, we observed an increase in the strength of the relationships (expressed by the determination coefficient, r2), from 0.05 to 0.17 (bacterioplankton and phytoplankton abundances) and from 0.09 to 0.44 (bacterial abundance and chl a). Our data suggest that the in-system ecological drivers (e.g. water temperature, trophic state, and flushing characteristics, i.e. lentic or lotic) determine the bacterioplankton abundance patterns more than other factors such as latitude or system typology. In a global perspective, the comparison between non-tropical and tropical/sub-tropical freshwaters showed that a lower proportion of phytoplankton carbon is transformed into bacterial carbon in the tropics.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In liquid cloud droplets, superoxide anion (O2(aq)-) is known to quickly consume ozone (O3(aq)), which is relatively insoluble. The significance of this reaction as a tropospheric O3 sink is sensitive to the abundance of O2(aq)- and therefore to the production of its main precursor, the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2(aq)). The aqueous-phase oxidation of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) is the major source of HO2(aq) in cloud droplets. Hence, the lack of explicit aqueous-phase chemical kinetics in global atmospheric models leads to a general underestimation of clouds as O3 sinks. In this study, the importance of in-cloud OVOC oxidation for tropospheric composition is assessed by using the Chemistry As A Boxmodel Application (CAABA) and the global ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, which are both capable of explicitly representing the relevant chemical transformations. For this analysis, three different in-cloud oxidation mechanisms are employed: (1) one including the basic oxidation of SO2(aq) by O3(aq) and H2O2(aq), which thus represents the capabilities of most global models; (2) the more advanced standard EMAC mechanism, which includes inorganic chemistry and simplified degradation of methane oxidation products; and (3) the detailed in-cloud OVOC oxidation scheme J\"ulich Aqueous-phase Mechanism of Organic Chemistry (JAMOC). By using EMAC, the global impact of each mechanism is assessed focusing mainly on tropospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs), HOx (HOx=OH+HO2), and O3. This is achieved by performing a detailed HOx and O3 budget analysis in the gas and aqueous phase. The resulting changes are evaluated against O3 and methanol (CH3OH) satellite observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) for 2015. In general, the explicit in-cloud oxidation leads to an overall reduction in predicted OVOC levels and reduces EMAC's overestimation of some OVOCs in the tropics. The in-cloud OVOC oxidation shifts the HO2 production from the gas to the aqueous phase. As a result, the O3 budget is perturbed with scavenging being enhanced and the gas-phase chemical losses being reduced. With the simplified in-cloud chemistry, about 13\,Tg\,yr-1 of O3 is scavenged, which increases to 336\,Tg\,yr-1 when JAMOC is used. The highest O3 reduction of 12\,\% is predicted in the upper troposphere\textendash lower stratosphere~(UTLS). These changes in the free troposphere significantly reduce the modelled tropospheric ozone columns, which are known to be generally overestimated by EMAC and other global atmospheric models.},

The interplay between iron, superoxide, and oxygen may also produce a cascade of other highly reactive transients in oxygenated natural waters. For microbes, the overall effect of reactions between superoxide and iron may be deleterious or beneficial, depending on the organism and its chemical environment.

After 0.45 \textmu m filtration, superoxide decayed in a pseudofirst order manner but more slowly than expected (rate constants varied from {$<$}10-4 to 9.7 \texttimes{} 10-3 s-1), which we hypothesize is due to complexation of metals that could otherwise scavenge superoxide, and the noncatalytic nature of superoxide decay at subnanomolar concentrations. Depth profiles revealed a particle-associated and nonphotochemically generated source of superoxide, implicating biological processes in its production. Superoxide in surface waters exhibited a diel cycle but concentrations were comparable to those in samples stored in the dark for at least 30 min, suggesting that the nonphotochemical source may dominate over abiotic photochemical superoxide production in the CRD. Elevated concentrations of superoxide in localized zones of the ocean may promote the reduction of several biologically important trace metals, thereby increasing their solubility and potential bioavailability.},

Little is known about the redox-based mechanisms that mediate diatom sensing and acclimation to environmental stress. Here we used a quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach to elucidate the redox-sensitive signaling network (redoxome) mediating the response of diatoms to oxidative stress. We quantified the degree of oxidation of 3,845 cysteines in the Phaeodactylum tricornutum proteome and identified approximately 300 redox-sensitive proteins. Intriguingly, we found redox-sensitive thiols in numerous enzymes composing the nitrogen assimilation pathway and the recently discovered diatom urea cycle. In agreement with this finding, the flux from nitrate into glutamine and glutamate, measured by the incorporation of 15N, was strongly inhibited under oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, by targeting the redox-sensitive GFP sensor to various subcellular localizations, we mapped organelle-specific oxidation patterns in response to variations in nitrogen quota and quality. We propose that redox regulation of nitrogen metabolism allows rapid metabolic plasticity to ensure cellular homeostasis, and thus is essential for the ecological success of diatoms in the marine ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The oxidation of 2{${'}$}-7{${'}$}-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) to the fluorescent 2{${'}$}-7{${'}$}-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was investigated by fluorescence, absorption, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). As has been previously reported, HRP/H2O2 oxidized DCFH to the highly fluorescent DCF. However, DCF fluorescence was still observed when H2O2 was omitted, although its intensity was reduced by 50\%. Surprisingly, the fluorescence increase, in the absence of exogenous H2O2, was still strongly inhibited by catalase, demonstrating that H2O2 was present and necessary for DCF formation. H2O2was apparently formed during either chemical or enzymatic deacetylation of 2{${'}$}-7{${'}$}-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), probably by auto-oxidation. Spectrophotometric measurements clearly showed that DCFH could be oxidized either by HRP-compound I or HRP-compound II with the obligate generation of the DCF semiquinone free radical (DCF\textbullet -). Oxidation of DCF\textbullet - to DCF by oxygen would yield superoxide (O2\textbullet -). ESR spectroscopy in conjunction with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) revealed the presence of both superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in the DCFH/H2O2/HRP system. Both radicals were also detected in the absence of added H2O2, although the intensities of the resultant adducts were decreased. This work demonstrates that DCF fluorescence cannot be used reliably to measure O2\textbullet - in cells because O2\textbullet - itself is formed during the conversion of DCFH to DCF by peroxidases. The disproportionation of superoxide forms H2O2 which, in the presence of peroxidase activity, will oxidize more DCFH to DCF with self-amplification of the fluorescence. Because the deacetylation of DCFH-DA, even by esterases, can produce H2O2, the use of this probe to measure H2O2 production in cells is problematic.},

  abstract = {Identifying major trends in biogeochemical composition of the oceans is essential to improve our understanding of biological responses to climate forcing. Using the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical Model combined with ocean color remote sensing data assimilation, we assessed the trends in phytoplankton composition (diatoms, cyanobacteria, coccolithophores, and chlorophytes) at a global scale for the period 1998\textendash 2012. We related these trends in phytoplankton to physical conditions (surface temperature, surface photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and mixed layer depth (MLD)) and nutrients (iron, silicate, and nitrate). We found a significant global decline in diatoms (-1.22\% yr-1, p {$<$} 0.05). This trend was associated with a significant (p {$<$} 0.05) shallowing of the MLD (-0.20\% yr-1), a significant increase in PAR (0.09\% yr-1), and a significant decline in nitrate (-0.38\% yr-1). The global decline in diatoms was mostly attributed to their decline in the North Pacific (-1.00\% yr-1, p {$<$} 0.05), where the MLD shallowed significantly and resulted in a decline in all three nutrients (p {$<$} 0.05). None of the other phytoplankton groups exhibited a significant change globally, but regionally there were considerable significant trends. A decline in nutrients in the northernmost latitudes coincided with a significant decline in diatoms (North Pacific, -1.00\% yr-1) and chlorophytes (North Atlantic, -9.70\% yr-1). In the northern midlatitudes (North Central Pacific and Atlantic) where nutrients were more scarce, a decline in nutrients was associated with a decline in smaller phytoplankton: cyanobacteria declined significantly in the North Central Pacific (-0.72\% yr-1) and Atlantic (-1.56\% yr-1), and coccolithophores declined significantly in the North Central Atlantic (-2.06\% yr-1). These trends represent the diversity and complexity of mechanisms that drives phytoplankton communities to adapt to variable conditions of nutrients, light, and mixed layer depth. These results provide a first insight into the existence of trends in phytoplankton composition over the maturing satellite ocean color era and illustrate how changes in the conditions of the oceans in the last 15 years may have affected them.},

On each sampling day, bottom seaice protists were collected at sites of high ({$>$}10 cm) and low ({$<$}10 cm) snow cover. The net observed growth rates of diatoms and nanoflagellates were significantly higher during the pre-bloom (24 February to 25 March) than the bloom (ca. 3 April to 23 May) period under low snow cover but were not different under high snow cover. In contrast, dinoflagellates showed relatively constant net observed growth rate before and during the bloom period under both snow covers. These results indicate that the 3 protist groups responded differently to changes in the light regime during the growth period. The decline of the protist community after the bloom period was related to a combination of factors including nitrogen deficiency and melting processes. Prior to the bloom, flagellated cells, likely heterotrophic, dominated numerically under high snow cover, whereas autotrophic protists, especially solitary diatoms, prevailed under low snow cover. During the bloom period, colonial diatoms such as Nitzschia frigida, N. promare, Navicula sp. 6, N. pelagica, and Fragilariopsis cylindrus dominated the bottom ice community irrespective of snow depth, although abundances were higher under low snow cover. The arborescent colonial N. frigida, a key species of landfast ice across circumarctic regions, was the most abundant bottom ice algal diatom throughout the entire season. During the post-bloom period, colonial and solitary diatoms declined more rapidly than nanoflagellates, suggesting that nanoflagellates, presumably heterotrophic, were better adapted to melting sea-ice conditions. Our results demonstrated that the availability of nitrate in the surface water limits the accumulation of algal biomass in the bottom horizon of Arctic landfast ice during the vernal growth season.},

Concentrations of H2O2 along the transect ranged from 8.5nM to 138.5nM, and varied seasonally with the highest mean concentrations measured in summer and the lowest in winter. Differences in the intensities of photosynthetically-active radiation between seasons explained much of this seasonal variation in H2O2 concentrations (r2=0.997, p{$<$}0.01). These data, as well as results from formation and decay studies, strongly support the present hypothesis that a photochemically-initiated formation mechanism causes seasonal variation in open ocean sea surface H2O2 concentrations east of New Zealand. Steady-state concentrations of superoxide (HO2/O2-) measured in depth-profile samples during a voyage in February 2009 ranged from below the detection limit (218pM) to a maximum of 32.7nM. Superoxide maxima were coincident with distinct deep chlorophyll maxima at two sampling sites in the Subtropical Front (STF) east of New Zealand. The data presented in the present study suggest that biologically-mediated production mechanisms can sometimes lead to steady-state concentrations of superoxide in seawater in the nanomolar range. The present study also confirms that solar irradiance alone is capable of explaining much of the natural temporal variation in H2O2 concentrations in surface seawater.},

  abstract = {Photosynthesis was measured in 14 species of marine plankton algae in relation to light intensites within the entire range to which natural phytoplankton populations may be exposed. A mean curve was constructed showing relative photosynthesis in marine phytoplankton as related to light intensity. From this curve and surface radiation data, relative values for photosynthesis were determined throughout the day at the surface and at depths in the ocean at which the surface intensity is reduced by given amounts. Integration of these values over the entire day gave values for daily relative photosynthesis at each depth considered, and integration of the daily values with depth resulted in a single figure for daily relative photosynthesis beneath a unit of sea surface. An empirically derived relationship was discovered between daily surface radiation and daily relative photosynthesis within the water column. From this relationship the effect of light intensity upon photosynthesis throughout the year at a temperate latitude was demonstrated. A preliminary method is described for estimating absolute daily photosynthesis beneath a square meter of sea surface from measurement of (1) photosynthesis of a sample of the population at light saturation, (2) the extinction coefficient of light in the water, and (3) the daily surface radiation. From an estimate of the ratio of photosynthesis to respiration at light saturation, the daily ratio P:R for the entire population is calculated. It is shown that phytoplankton populations cannot photosynthesize sufficiently to compensate for their own respiration during periods of low solar radiation, as may occur in the winter months at temperate or northern latitudes.},

According to flow cytometric studies with nutrient-saturated cultures in the laboratory at 15 \textdegree C, in vivo fluorescence and chlorophyll per cell of T. oceanica varied negligibly between cultures adapted to 70 and 300 {$\mu$}mol m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}. The cultures decreased in cell density when exposed to outdoor light (2800 {$\mu$}mol m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$} at noon), and the still viable subpopulation exhibited a 70 to 75 \% lower fluorescence and chlorophyll per cell than the laboratory cultures. In T. pseudonana the same photoadaptive parameters were markedly dependent on photon flux. It grew actively albeit at a reduced rate in strong outdoor light, at which in vivo fluorescence was reduced by 30 to 60 \%. Suppression of fluorescence was reversible and independent of cellular chlorophyll content (which increased somewhat) and was completed within 30 to 40 min. This 'sunglass' effect is apparently a manifestation of a protective mechanism against strong light and should be advantageous for a neritic opportunistic species. Rates of adaptation were within known limits. Neither species grew actively at 17 {$\mu$}mol m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}, at which viable subpopulations retained the photoadaptational characteristics of the inoculum. Thus sudden transfer of algae to marginally low light arrests the photoadaptational response. Decreasing average fluorescence and volume per cell in slowly dying cultures of T. pseudonana was solely due to increasing prominence of a subpopulation of cells with abnormally low fluorescence and small volume.]}

Nostoc 29133 was better able to tolerate H2O2-induced inhibition of chlorophyll a and photosystem II performance, as compared to Anabaena 7120. The intracellular hydroperoxide level (indicator of oxidative status) also did not exhibit as much a rise in Nostoc 29133, as it did in Anabaena 7120 after H2O2 treatment. Accordingly, Nostoc 29133 showed higher intrinsic constitutive catalase activity than Anabaena 7120 indicating that the superior tolerance of Nostoc 29133 stems from its higher ability to decompose H2O2. It is suggested that difference in H2O2 tolerance between closely related filamentous cyanobacteria, as is borne out by this study, may be taken into account for judicious selection and effective use of strains in biotechnology.},

  abstract = {Background Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to play a major role in cell death pathways and bleaching in scleractinian corals. Direct measurements of ROS in corals are conspicuously in short supply, partly due to inherent problems with ROS quantification in cellular systems. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we characterized the dynamics of the reactive oxygen species superoxide anion radical (O2-) in the external milieu of the coral Stylophora pistillata. Using a sensitive, rapid and selective chemiluminesence-based technique, we measured extracellular superoxide production and detoxification activity of symbiont (non-bleached) and aposymbiont (bleached) corals, and of cultured Symbiodinium (from clades A and C). Bleached and non-bleached Stylophora fragments were found to produce superoxide at comparable rates of 10-11\textendash 10-9 mol O2- mg protein-1 min-1 in the dark. In the light, a two-fold enhancement in O2- production rates was observed in non-bleached corals, but not in bleached corals. Cultured Symbiodinium produced superoxide in the dark at a rate of . Light was found to markedly enhance O2- production. The NADPH Oxidase inhibitor Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) strongly inhibited O2- production by corals (and more moderately by algae), possibly suggesting an involvement of NADPH Oxidase in the process. An extracellular O2- detoxifying activity was found for bleached and non-bleached Stylophora but not for Symbiodinium. The O2- detoxifying activity was partially characterized and found to resemble that of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Conclusions/Significance The findings of substantial extracellular O2- production as well as extracellular O2- detoxifying activity may shed light on the chemical interactions between the symbiont and its host and between the coral and its environment. Superoxide production by Symbiodinium possibly implies that algal bearing corals are more susceptible to an internal build-up of O2-, which may in turn be linked to oxidative stress mediated bleaching.},

An examination of the type material of C. perforatus was carried out with scanning electron microscopy and a lecto- and epitype were chosen. The information obtained was substantiated and supplemented by examination of recent plankton material from Buenos Aires (Argentina) coastal waters. On the basis of these analyses the description of C. perforatus was emended and compared with the closely related C. radiatus.},

This study presents floristic data obtained from the first long term monitoring survey ever made in Lake Kivu (over two and a half years). Samples were collected twice a month from the southern basin, and twice a year (once in each season) from the northern, eastern and western basins. In open lake habitats, the four basins presented similar species composition. The most common species were the pennate diatoms Nitzschia bacata Hust. and Fragilaria danica (K\"utz.) Lange-Bert., and the cyanobacteria Planktolyngbya limnetica Lemm. and Synechococcus sp. The centric diatom Urosolenia sp. and the cyanobacterium Microcystis sp. were also very abundant, mostly near the surface under daily stratification conditions. Some typical low epilimnion/metalimnion species were Cryptaulax sp., Cryptomonas sp., Rhodomonas sp. and Merismopedia trolleri Bach. Vertical stratification appeared to be the most important factor of diversification. Limited changes were apparent in comparison with the situation described in 1937 after the first Belgian expeditions. No evidence of an effect of the planktivorous sardine Limnothrissa miodon Boulenger (introduced from Lake Tanganyika) on phytoplankton diversity is available.},

The diatoms include both centric species, which may have radial or polar symmetry, and the pennates, which include raphid and araphid species and arose within the centric lineage. Here, we use combined microscopic and molecular information to reclassify a diatom strain CCMP470, previously annotated as a radial centric species related to Leptocylindrus danicus, as an araphid pennate species in the staurosiroid lineage, within the genus Plagiostriata. CCMP470 shares key ultrastructural features with Plagiostriata taxa, such as the presence of a sternum with parallel striae, and the presence of a highly reduced labiate process on its valve; and this evolutionary position is robustly supported by multigene phylogenetic analysis. We additionally present a draft genome of CCMP470, which is the first genome available for a staurosiroid lineage. 270 Pfams (19\%) found in the CCMP470 genome are not known in other diatom genomes, which otherwise does not hold big novelties compared to genomes of non-staurosiroid diatoms. Notably, our DNA library contains the genome of a bacterium within the Rhodobacterales, an alpha-proteobacterial lineage known frequently to associate with algae. We demonstrate the presence of commensal alpha-proteobacterial sequences in other published algal genome and transcriptome datasets, which may indicate widespread and persistent co-occurrence.},

Prochlorococcus was isolated around 20 years ago and is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. The genus comprises specific ecotypes which are phylogenetically distinct and differ markedly in their photophysiology, allowing growth over a broad range of light and nutrient conditions within the 45\textdegree N to 40\textdegree S latitudinal belt that they occupy. Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are closely related, together forming a discrete picophytoplankton clade, but are distinguishable by their possession of dissimilar light-harvesting apparatuses and differences in cell size and elemental composition. Synechococcus strains have a ubiquitous oceanic distribution compared to that of Prochlorococcus strains and are characterized by phylogenetically discrete lineages with a wide range of pigmentation. In this review, we put our current knowledge of marine picocyanobacterial genomics into an environmental context and present previously unpublished genomic information arising from extensive genomic comparisons in order to provide insights into the adaptations of these marine microbes to their environment and how they are reflected at the genomic level.},

The ecological success of these two genera suggests they possess sophisticated strategies to respond to variations in their environment. Indeed, it appears that it is the in situ community structure of these organisms which underlies this success, with the existence of specific ecotypes or lineages occupying different niches to populate the world's oceans. For Prochlorococcus there is now excellent physiological and genomic data for defining the basis of this niche partitioning particularly with respect to its vertical distribution down a water column. The situation for Synechococcus is more complex probably due to the larger spatial distribution of marine Synechococcus in oceanic ecosystems. This has led to extensive phylogenetic and physiological variation within the Synechococcus genus but the genomic basis for this phenotypic variation, and hence niche adaptation is less well understood. This chapter seeks to give an overview of the knowledge gained on these organisms over the last three decades focusing on aspects of ecology, physiology and molecular biology that are pertinent to this niche adaptation process.},

In this review we discuss the two faces of ROS \textemdash{} redox biology and oxidative stress \textemdash{} and their contribution to both physiological and pathological conditions. Redox biology involves a small increase in ROS levels that activates signaling pathways to initiate biological processes, while oxidative stress denotes high levels of ROS that result in damage to DNA, protein or lipids. Thus, the response to ROS displays hormesis, given that the opposite effect is observed at low levels compared with that seen at high levels. Here, we argue that redox biology, rather than oxidative stress, underlies physiological and pathological conditions.},

Understanding the controls on the growth and demise of E. huxleyi blooms is essential for predicting the biogeochemical fate of their organic carbon and nutrients. In this study, we show that the production of nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous, membrane-permeable free radical, is a hallmark of early-stage lytic infection in E. huxleyi by Coccolithoviruses, both in culture and in natural populations in the North Atlantic. Enhanced NO production was detected both intra- and extra-cellularly in laboratory cultures, and treatment of cells with an NO scavenger significantly reduced viral production. Pre-treatment of exponentially growing E. huxleyi cultures with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) prior to challenge with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) led to greater cell survival, suggesting that NO may have a cellular antioxidant function. Indeed, cell lysates generated from cultures treated with SNAP and undergoing infection displayed enhanced ability to detoxify H2O2. Lastly, we show that fluorescent indicators of cellular ROS, NO, and death, in combination with classic DNA- and lipid-based biomarkers of infection, can function as real-time diagnostic tools to identify and contextualize viral infection in natural E. huxleyi blooms.},

We followed an experimental short-term approach that allowed the assessment of modified NGE during the first hours of specifically modified enzymatic steps of the Mg branch of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, when pleiotropic effects of other signals can be avoided. In response to 24-h-induced silencing of CHLH, CHLM, and CHL27 encoding the CHLH subunit of Mg chelatase, the Mg protoporphyrin methyltransferase and Mg protoporphyrin monomethylester cyclase, respectively, deactivated gene expression rapidly led to reduced activity of the corresponding enzymes and altered Mg porphyrin levels. But NGE was not substantially altered. When these three genes were continuously inactivated for up to 4 d, changes of transcript levels of nuclear genes were determined. CHL27 silencing for more than 24h results in necrotic leaf lesions and modulated transcript levels of oxidative stress-responsive and photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs). The prolonged deactivation of CHLH and CHLM results in slightly elevated transcript levels of PhANGs and tetrapyrrole-associated genes. These time-resolved studies indicate a complex scenario for the contribution of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis on NGE mediated by 1O2-induced signaling and feedback-regulated ALA synthesis.},

  abstract = {Phyteuma globulariifolium is a high alpine plant species growing in the European Alps and the Pyrenees. In order to elucidate its glacial history, 325 individuals from 69 populations were analysed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. A strongly hierarchical phylogeographical pattern was detected: Two major east-west vicariant groups can be separated along a gap in the distributional area. A further subdivision into at least four populational groups is in congruence with presumed peripheral glacial refugia. There is no indication for survival on unglaciated mountain tops (nunataks) in the interior of the Pleistocene ice shield covering the Alps. Our results favour glacial survival in peripheral, unglaciated or not fully glaciated areas. Populations of P. globulariifolium in the Pyrenees are the result of relatively recent long-distance dispersal. Within the Alps, there is strong differentiation among groups of populations, whereas within them the differentiation is weak. This suggests high levels of gene-flow over short to middle distances.},

  abstract = {Bacterial diheme c-type cytochrome peroxidases (BCCPs) catalyze the periplasmic reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water. The gammaproteobacterium Shewanella oneidensis produces the peroxidase CcpA under a number of anaerobic conditions, including dissimilatory iron-reducing conditions. We wanted to understand the function of this protein in the organism and its putative connection to the electron transport chain to ferric iron. CcpA was isolated and tested for peroxidase activity, and its structural conformation was analyzed by X-ray crystallography. CcpA exhibited in vitro peroxidase activity and had a structure typical of diheme peroxidases. It was produced in almost equal amounts under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. With 50 mM ferric citrate and 50 {$\mu$}M oxygen in the growth medium, CcpA expression results in a strong selective advantage for the cell, which was detected in competitive growth experiments with wild-type and {$\Delta$}ccpA mutant cells that lack the entire ccpA gene due to a markerless deletion. We were unable to reduce CcpA directly with CymA, MtrA, or FccA, which are known key players in the chain of electron transport to ferric iron and fumarate but identified the small monoheme ScyA as a mediator of electron transport between CymA and BCCP. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of a complete chain of electron transport to a periplasmic c-type cytochrome peroxidase. This study furthermore reports the possibility of establishing a specific electron transport chain using c-type cytochromes.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli generates about 14 microM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) per s when it grows exponentially in glucose medium. The steady-state intracellular concentration of H(2)O(2) depends on the rates at which this H(2)O(2) is dissipated by scavenging enzymes and by efflux from the cell. The rates of H(2)O(2) degradation by the two major scavenging enzymes, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and catalase, were quantified. In order to estimate the rate of efflux, the permeability coefficient of membranes for H(2)O(2) was determined. The coefficient is 1.6 x 10(-3) cm/s, indicating that permeability is substantial but not unlimited. These data allowed internal H(2)O(2) fluxes and concentrations to be calculated. Under these growth conditions, Ahp scavenges the majority of the endogenous H(2)O(2), with a small fraction degraded by catalase and virtually none persisting long enough to penetrate the membrane and exit the cell. The robust scavenging activity maintains the H(2)O(2) concentration inside glucose-grown cells at {$<$}10(-7) M, substantially below the level (10(-6) M) at which toxicity is evident. When extracellular H(2)O(2) is present, its flux into the cell can be rapid, but the internal concentration may still be an order of magnitude lower than that outside. The presence of such gradients was confirmed in experiments that revealed different degrees of oxidative stress in cocultured scavenger-deficient mutants. The limited permeability of membranes to H(2)O(2) rationalizes the compartmentalization of scavenging systems and predicts that bacteria that excrete redox-cycling drugs do not experience the same H(2)O(2) dose that they impose on their competitors.},

It was very recently demonstrated that a SAR11 isolate also shares this capability when phosphate starved in culture. Yet, the extent to which this process occurs in other marine heterotrophic bacteria and in the natural environment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the substitution of membrane phospholipids for a variety of non-phosphorus lipids is a conserved response to P deficiency among phylogenetically diverse marine heterotrophic bacteria, including members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria. By deletion mutagenesis and complementation in the model marine bacterium Phaeobacter sp. MED193 and heterologous expression in recombinant Escherichia coli, we confirm the roles of a phospholipase C (PlcP) and a glycosyltransferase in lipid remodelling. Analyses of the Global Ocean Sampling and Tara Oceans metagenome data sets demonstrate that PlcP is particularly abundant in areas characterized by low phosphate concentrations. Furthermore, we show that lipid remodelling occurs seasonally and responds to changing nutrient conditions in natural microbial communities from the Mediterranean Sea. Together, our results point to the key role of lipid substitution as an adaptive strategy enabling heterotrophic bacteria to thrive in the vast P-depleted areas of the ocean.},

  abstract = {The utilization of inorganic carbon and role of the coccoliths were investigated in intact cells and protoplasts of a marine unicellular calcareous alga, Emiliania huxleyi. Protoplasts with high photosynthetic activity were obtained by artificial decalcification with 50 mM MES-NaOH (pH5.5). (1) The kinetics of the photosynthetic evolution of O2 at various concentrations of externally added NaHCO3 were the same for intact cells and protoplasts, indicating that the kinetic properties with respect to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were not affected by the presence or absence of the coccoliths on the cell surface. Double-reciprocal plots and plots of the concentration of substrate divided by velocity (s/v) against the concentration of substrate (s) were biphasic in the case of both intact cells and protoplasts. The CO2-utilization reaction was, therefore, considered to involve two processes with different values of Km and Vmax. From the kinetic analyses, Km and Vmax [{$\mu$}moles O2 (ml PCV)-1 h-1] were deduced to be 92 {$\mu$}M and 76.3 for a ``low-Km'' reaction and 4.1 mM and 252 for a ``high-Km'' reaction, respectively. (2) In short-term (40-min) experiments, time courses of the total uptake of 14C-DIC and the incorporation of 14C into acid-stable products of photosynthesis and the internal pool of DIC, determined as acid-labile compounds, under CO2-limiting conditions (80 {$\mu$}M) were very similar for intact cells and protoplasts. However, incorporation of 14C into CaCO3 apparently occurred more slowly in protoplasts than in intact cells. (3) In long term (24-h) experiments, patterns of incorporation of 14C were almost same for intact cells and protoplasts, with the exception that the amount of 14C incorporated into CaCO3 was much smaller in the former than the latter. The production of Ca14CO3 increased during the course of 10 h after a 4-h lag. However, after 10 h the level of Ca14CCO3 started to decrease. The decrease was accompanied by an increase in 14C in the products of photosynthesis, suggesting that CaCO3 was reutilized for the photosynthetic fixation of CO2 and, therefore, that the coccoliths function as sites of storage of DIC. However, the internal level of DIC remained at the same level even after the supply of external DIC has been almost completely depleted.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a strong oxidizing agent. High concentration H2O2 or High Test Peroxide (HTP) has been used extensively in the past in propulsion applications as mono and bipropellant. At low temperature, HTP can be catalytically decomposed to water and oxygen. Drawbacks to this approach include catalyst poisoning due to the presence of stabilizers in HTP, and susceptibility of the metal catalyst to melting because of the intense heat release. This renders the use of catalysts not only inconvenient but also quite expensive. An alternate approach for HTP decomposition is thermal, where no catalyst is required. HTP decomposition is accompanied by the production of enormous amount of heat that often leads to runaway reactions and subsequent explosion . If the rate of thermal decomposition can be controlled, the ensuing technology would prove to be a viable and inexpensive alternative to using catalysts. This technology has the potential to replace any device that decomposes H2O2 catalytically. Also, the controlled thermal decomposer can be used as an accelerator to heat any substance quickly at the expense of very low power. In order to control non-catalytic HTP decomposition, a deeper understanding of the chemical mechanism for H2O2 decomposition must be developed. The current work reports the development of detailed kinetic steps for HTP decomposition over a wide range of temperature and pressure. The resulting mechanism is then used to perform CFD simulations of a commercial HTP decomposer (patented by Pratt \& Whitney) to explore safe operating conditions. A similar strategy can be applied to model COIL technology.},

Morphological, molecular, and biochemical analyses revealed that the isolate belonged to Auxenochlorella protothecoides. The current study is the first record of this species in Korea. The microalgal strain was named as A. protothecoides MM0011 and its growth, lipid and pigment compositions, and biomass properties were investigated. The strain is able to thrive in a wide range of temperatures (5\textasciitilde 35\textdegree C) and to withstand up to 1.5 M NaCl. The results of GC/MS analysis showed that the isolate was rich in nutritionally important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Its major fatty acids were linoleic acid (27.6\%) and {$\alpha$}-linolenic acid (39.6\%). Thus, this indigenous microalga has potential as an alternative source of {$\omega$}3 and {$\omega$}6 PUFAs, which currently come from fish and plant oils. Also, the HPLC analysis revealed that the value-added antioxidant, lutein, was biosynthesized as the accessory pigments by the microalga. A proximate analysis showed that the volatile matter content was 85.6\% and an ultimate analysis indicated that the gross calorific value was 20.3 MJ kg-1. Since 40.5\% of total nitrogen and 27.9\% of total phosphorus were removed from the medium, respectively, it also has potential as a feedstock for bio-fuel applications which could be coupled to wastewater treatment. In addition, the biomass may also serve as an excellent animal feed because of its high protein content (51.4\%). Therefore, A. proto-thecoides MM0011 shows promise for application in production of microalgae-based biochemicals and as a biomass feedstock.},

It has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes. It is essential for neutralizing the noxious hydrogen peroxide both in the nature and the various industries such as dairy, textile and pharmaceutics. It also has the merit of being one of the first protein crystals to be isolated. Ironically its three-dimensional structure was discerned some forty years later. However through the times this senile enzyme has continued to intrigue the scientists by surprising facts and phenomena, such as peculiar interweaving of subunits and remarkable thermal stability. It is also known for suicide inactivation by its own substrate. Catalase is known to be implicated in various medical scenarios and its levels have served as a marker in that capacity. It has even been incorporated into several pharmaceuticals. This review strives to clarify these perspectives. It also draws attention to the biophysical contributions offered by thermodynamics and kinetics in these discoveries. The ultimate aim of this review, however, is to state that the venerable catalase will continue to bewilder us with its mysteries well into the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Two isoforms of ascorbate peroxidase, namely, APX 1 and APX 2 with subunit molecular weight of 28.5 and 34kDa, respectively, were purified from leaves of 15-day grown rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants. The molecular and enzymatic properties of the two isoforms differed significantly but both belonged to the class of ascorbate specific heme peroxidases and were inhibited by thiol reagents. The two isozymes were separated from each other at the DEAE-Sephacel chromatography step of purification and were named APX 1 and APX 2 in the order of elution in the chromatography. APX 2 accounted for 74\% of the total activity. The Km values of APX 1 and APX 2 for ascorbate were 400 and 200{$\mu$}M and those for hydrogen peroxide were 33 and 76{$\mu$}M, respectively. Both isoforms had very high preference for ascorbate as electron donor. pH optima for APX 1 and APX 2 were 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. Activity of both isoforms was completely lost by heat treatment at 80\textdegree C for 20min or in presence of 150mM NaCl in the assay medium. A 40\% polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) in the assay medium led to about 50\% inhibition in the activity of APX 1 and 65\% inhibition of APX 2 with an increase in enzyme Km values. Incorporation of 1M proline, glycine betaine or sucrose in presence of PEG in the assay medium led to a pronounced restoration in enzyme activity with decrease in Km values. Glycine betaine appeared to be an effective protectant for both isoforms under in vitro water stressed conditions. APX 2 appeared to be more sensitive to the metals Ni, Al and As when compared to APX 1. When rice seedlings were raised in sand cultures in nutrient solution containing 1mM Al2(SO4)3, during a 5\textendash 20 day growth period about 0.5\textendash 1.3 times higher activity of APX was observed compared to the activity in controls. Similarly, rice seedlings subjected to polyethylene glycol induced water deficit for 24h showed elevated APX activity compared to unstressed seedlings. Ascorbate peroxidase in rice seedlings appears to have an important role in detoxification of H2O2 under abiotic stressful conditions.},

It is known to catalyze H2O2 into water and oxygen in an energy-efficient manner in the cells exposed to environmental stress. Catalase is located in all major sites of H2O2 production in the cellular environment (such as peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol and chloroplast) of higher plants. Multiple molecular forms of catalase isozymes indicate its versatile role within the plant system. The modulation of H2O2 by the catalase isozymes within specific cells or organelles at specific time and developmental phases directly or indirectly interferes with signal transduction in plants. Catalase isozymes CAT-1, CAT-2, CAT-3 have been encoded by structural genes Cat1, Cat2 and Cat3, respectively. The expression of cat gene shows time, species and stress specificity. Catalase deficiency in plants develops anomalies such as chlorosis and head sterility and sensitivity to normal photorespiratory conditions. The molecular phylogeny of plant catalase proteins also reveals the structure and functional links among a wide range of plant species. This chapter compiles the latest information on catalase structure, localization, biochemistry, genes and function in plants.},

Various environmental stresses lead to excessive production of ROS causing progressive oxidative damage and ultimately cell death. Despite their destructive activity, they are well-described second messengers in a variety of cellular processes, including conferment of tolerance to various environmental stresses. Whether ROS would serve as signaling molecules or could cause oxidative damage to the tissues depends on the delicate equilibrium between ROS production, and their scavenging. Efficient scavenging of ROS produced during various environmental stresses requires the action of several nonenzymatic as well as enzymatic antioxidants present in the tissues. In this paper, we describe the generation, sites of production and role of ROS as messenger molecules as well as inducers of oxidative damage. Further, the antioxidative defense mechanisms operating in the cells for scavenging of ROS overproduced under various stressful conditions of the environment have been discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {The glutathione transferases (GSTs; also known as glutathione S-transferases) are major phase II detoxification enzymes found mainly in the cytosol. In addition to their role in catalysing the conjugation of electrophilic substrates to glutathione (GSH), these enzymes also carry out a range of other functions. They have peroxidase and isomerase activities, they can inhibit the Jun N-terminal kinase (thus protecting cells against H(2)O(2)-induced cell death), and they are able to bind non-catalytically a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands. Cytosolic GSTs of mammals have been particularly well characterized, and were originally classified into Alpha, Mu, Pi and Theta classes on the basis of a combination of criteria such as substrate/inhibitor specificity, primary and tertiary structure similarities and immunological identity. Non-mammalian GSTs have been much less well characterized, but have provided a disproportionately large number of three-dimensional structures, thus extending our structure-function knowledge of the superfamily as a whole. Moreover, several novel classes identified in non-mammalian species have been subsequently identified in mammals, sometimes carrying out functions not previously associated with GSTs. These studies have revealed that the GSTs comprise a widespread and highly versatile superfamily which show similarities to non-GST stress-related proteins. Independent classification systems have arisen for groups of organisms such as plants and insects. This review surveys the classification of GSTs in non-mammalian sources, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, insects and helminths, and attempts to relate them to the more mainstream classification system for mammalian enzymes. The implications of this classification with regard to the evolution of GSTs are discussed.},

  abstract = {The distribution of diatom taxa was studied in the Enderby Basin, East Antarctica during the austral summer of 2010. In this study, the influence of freshwater at east of the 55\textdegree E was observed due to the melting of sea-ice, resulting in stratified (shallow Mixed Layer Depth (MLD)) and low saline conditions. This decrease in sea-surface salinity was associated with an increase in pCO2 and decrease in total diatom abundance. Corethron criophilum was recognized as the most abundant diatom (absolute abundance up to 30~\texttimes ~104~cells L-1; 35\% contribution to total diatom taxa) and its elevated abundances recorded at west of the 55\textdegree E. Reduced C. criophilum and increased abundances of Fragilariopsis curta and Thalassiothrix antarctica were documented at east of the 55oE. This study shows that despite shallow MLD and macronutrient availability, the diatom abundance at east of 55oE was low. We suspect that, the factors such as micronutrient unavailability, freshening of the upper water column, transportation by water masses, and photoinhibition possibly affect the production of diatoms at east of the 55oE. The elevated abundance of diatoms to the west of the 55\textdegree E resulted in low pCO2 levels and high meso-zooplankton abundance. This study suggests the need of long term monitoring of phytoplankton community structure and factors influencing their production in the East Antarctic region. This is essential to better understand the projected effects of physico-chemical conditions (especially pCO2 and temperature) on Southern Ocean phytoplankton and thus biological carbon pump.},

  abstract = {In the Ross Sea, there are two major phytoplankton functional groups: diatoms and prymnesiophytes (dominated by Phaeocystis antarctica). Phaeocystis antarctica often occurs in colonial form, but also as solitary cells, and the two forms have distinct ecological roles. A comparison of the growth characteristics of solitary and colonial forms of Phaeocystis sp. is essential to understanding the differential impact each has on biogeochemical and ecological processes, and to allow parameterization of each form in numerical models. We measured the biomass and photosynthetic responses of two size fractions (\&gt;20 and \&lt;20 \textmu m), representing colonies and solitary cells, at locations dominated by P. antarctica to assess the relative photosynthetic potential of the two forms. While the relative contribution of each form to total P. antarctica biomass differed among years, there were no significant differences between maximum photosynthetic rates of colonial and solitary forms within years. Substantial interannual variations in biomass and maximum photosynthetic rates normalized to chlorophyll a (PmB) and initial light-limited rates of photosynthesis ({$\alpha$}) were observed among years for the colonial fractions; however, interannual variations in maximum rates of photosynthesis or {$\alpha$} of solitary cells were not observed. A laboratory experiment with P. antarctica, together with field data, showed that growth stage of colonies strongly affected the maximum photosynthetic rates. Under nutrient-replete conditions and exponential growth, colonial cells had higher maximum photosynthetic rates than solitary cells, but as growth rate declined and senescence began, the solitary cells' rates became greater. This may be a reason for the high abundance of colonies that is often found in the Ross Sea during austral spring. Our results suggest that photosynthetic rates may influence the composition of the morphotypes of Phaeocystis, but do not appear to be the sole factor in regulating this critical biological variable.},

We analyzed these light-induced chloroplast migrations using a scanning laser microbeam provided by a confocal microscope for intracellular irradiation. Spot irradiation of a blue laser microbeam induced rapid assemblage of chroloplasts into the nuclear cytoplasm regardless of the spot position and spot number. On the other hand, one or two spots of green laser microbeam induced chloroplast accumulation at the spots, although increasing spot numbers suppressed chloroplast accumulation at each spot. In our experimental condition, ca 1 min of blue-light irradiation was sufficient to stimulate movement, whereas green-light irradiation required uninterrupted and longer irradiation time (ca 15 min). Chloroplast assemblage induced by blue-light required extracellular Ca2+, and was inhibited by Ca2+channel antagonists. Furthermore, higher efficiencies of chloroplast migration were obtained when a single beam spot was fragmented and scattered over wider area of plasma membrane. These observations suggested that blue-light induced a response at the plasma membrane, which subsequently activated Ca2+permeable channels. This sequence of physiological events is identical to what was previously observed with chloroplast movement in response to mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, experiments with the cytoskeleton-disrupting agents, colchicine and cytochalasin D, indicated that blue-light-induced chloroplast movement required microtubules whereas the green-light-induced response to beam spot required actin filaments.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture industries are under threat from noxious red tides, but harm can be mitigated by precautions such as early harvesting and restricting fish feeding to just before the outbreak of a red tide. Therefore, accurate techniques for forecasting red-tide outbreaks are strongly needed. Omics analyses have the potential to expand our understanding of the eco-physiology of these organisms at the molecular level, and to facilitate identification of molecular markers for forecasting their population dynamics and occurrence of damages to fisheries. Red tides of marine raphidophytes, especially Chattonella species, often extensively harm aquaculture industries in regions with a temperate climate around the world. A red tide of Chattonella tends to develop just after an input of nutrients along the coast. Chattonella displays diurnal vertical migration regulated by a weak blue light, so it photosynthesizes in the surface layer during the daytime and takes up nutrients in the bottom layer during the nighttime. Superoxide produced by Chattonella cells is a strong candidate for the cause of its toxicity to bacteria and fishes. Here we conducted mRNA-seq of Chattonella antiqua to identify genes with functions closely related to the dynamics of the noxious red tide, such as photosynthesis, photoreception, nutrient uptake, and superoxide production. The genes related to photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis and nutrient uptake had high similarity with those of model organisms of plants and algae and other red-tide microalgae. We identified orthologous genes of photoreceptors such as aureochrome (newly five genes), the cryptochrome/photolyase (CRY/PHR) family (6-4PHR, plant CRY or cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer [CPD] Class III, CPD Class II, and CRY-DASH), and phytochrome (four genes), which regulate various physiological processes such as flagellar motion and cell cycle in model organisms. Six orthologous genes of NADPH oxidase, which produces superoxide on the cell membrane, were found and divided into two types: one with 5\textendash 6 transmembrane domains and another with 11 transmembrane domains. The present study should open the way for analyzing the eco-physiological features of marine raphidophytes at the molecular level.},

In the absence of superoxide dismutase, catalase produced Compound I and another species. The formation of Compound I is due to the reaction of ferric catalase with hydrogen peroxide, which is generated by the disproportionation of the superoxide anion (O-2). The kinetic difference spectrum showed that the other species was neither Compound I nor II. In the presence of superoxide dismutase, the formation of this species was found to be inhibited, whereas that of Compound I was little affected. This suggests that this species is formed by the reaction of ferric catalase with O-2 and is probably the oxy form of this enzyme (Compound III). The rate constant for the reaction of O-2 and ferric catalase increased with a decrease in pH (cf. 4.5 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 at pH 9 and 4.6 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 at pH 5.). The pH dependence of the rate constant can be explained by assuming that HO2 reacts with this enzyme more rapidly than O-2.},

In particular, molecular and cellular mechanisms enabling the establishment and maintenance of obligate endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates require further clarification. By extension, such understanding may also shed light upon environmental conditions that promote the collapse of this mutualism. Genomic data undergird studies of all symbiotic processes. Here we review recent genomic data derived from the scleractinian coral, Acropora digitifera, and the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium minutum. We discuss Acropora genes involved in calcification, embryonic development, innate immunity, apoptosis, autophagy, UV resistance, fluorescence, photoreceptors, circadian clocks, etc. We also detail gene loss in amino acid metabolism that may explain at least part of the Acropora stress-response. Characteristic features of the Symbiodinium genome are also reviewed, focusing on the expansion of certain gene families, the molecular basis for permanently condensed chromatin, unique spliceosomal splicing, and unusual gene arrangement. Salient features of the Symbiodinium plastid and mitochondrial genomes are also illuminated. Although many questions regarding these interdependent genomes remain, we summarize information necessary for future studies of coral-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis.},

While these oleaginous microorganisms generally produce only small amounts of lipids under optimal growth conditions, their lipid accumulation machinery can be induced by environmental stresses, such as nutrient limitation and an inhospitable physical environmental. As common second messengers of many stress factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may act as a regulator of cellular responses to extracellular environmental signaling. Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that ROS may act as a mediator of lipid accumulation, which is associated with dramatic changes in the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. However, the specific mechanisms of ROS involvement in the crosstalk between extracellular stress signaling and intracellular lipid synthesis require further investigation. Here, we summarize current knowledge on stress-induced lipid biosynthesis and the putative role of ROS in the control of lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms. Understanding such links may provide guidance for the development of stress-based strategies to enhance microbial lipid production.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Dinoflagellates are known for their capacity to form harmful blooms (e.g., ``red tides'') and as symbiotic, photosynthetic partners for corals. These unicellular eukaryotes have permanently condensed, liquid-crystalline chromosomes and immense nuclear genome sizes, often several times the size of the human genome. Here we describe the first draft assembly of a dinoflagellate nuclear genome, providing insights into its genome organization and gene inventory. Results Sequencing reads from Symbiodinium minutum were assembled into 616 Mbp gene-rich DNA regions that represented roughly half of the estimated 1,500 Mbp genome of this species. The assembly encoded {$\sim$}42,000 protein-coding genes, consistent with previous dinoflagellate gene number estimates using transcriptomic data. The Symbiodinium genome contains duplicated genes for regulator of chromosome condensation proteins, nearly one-third of which have eukaryotic orthologs, whereas the remainder have most likely been acquired through bacterial horizontal gene transfers. Symbiodinium genes are enriched in spliceosomal introns (mean~= 18.6 introns/gene). Donor and acceptor splice sites are unique, with 5{${'}$} sites utilizing not only GT but also GC and GA, whereas at 3{${'}$} sites, a conserved G is present after AG. All spliceosomal snRNA genes (U1\textendash U6) are clustered in the genome. Surprisingly, the Symbiodinium genome displays unidirectionally aligned genes throughout the genome, forming a cluster-like gene arrangement. Conclusions We show here that a dinoflagellate genome exhibits unique and divergent characteristics when compared to those of other eukaryotes. Our data elucidate the organization and gene inventory of dinoflagellates and lay the foundation for future studies of this remarkable group of eukaryotes.},

ROS have also been implicated as important regulatory and signaling elements in a variety of cellular processes (Foyer and Noctor, 2005). ROS are constantly produced during the course of photosynthesis and respiration, whereas redox homeostasis in the cell is tightly controlled by redundant protective mechanisms. Disruption of these protective mechanisms can cause oxidative stress, leading to oxidative damage and cell death. Measuring oxidative stress in the cell requires sensitive and robust assays for ROS detection, accurate quantitation, and measurements of intrinsic cell defense responses.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The process of gene fusion involves the formation of a single chimeric gene from multiple complete or partial gene sequences. Gene fusion is recognized as an important mechanism by which genes and their protein products can evolve new functions. The presence-absence of gene fusions can also be useful characters for inferring evolutionary relationships between organisms. RESULTS: Here we show that the nuclear genomes of two unrelated single-celled algae, the cryptophyte Guillardia theta and the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans, possess an unexpected diversity of genes for ubiquitin fusion proteins, including novel arrangements in which ubiquitin occupies amino-terminal, carboxyl-terminal, and internal positions relative to its fusion partners. We explore the evolution of the ubiquitin multigene family in both genomes, and show that both algae possess a gene encoding an ubiquitin-nickel superoxide dismutase fusion protein (Ubiq-NiSOD) that is widely but patchily distributed across the eukaryotic tree of life - almost exclusively in phototrophs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ubiquitin fusion proteins are more common than currently appreciated; because of its small size, the ubiquitin coding region can go undetected when gene predictions are carried out in an automated fashion. The punctate distribution of the Ubiq-NiSOD fusion across the eukaryotic tree could serve as a beacon for the spread of plastids from eukaryote to eukaryote by secondary and/or tertiary endosymbiosis.},

  abstract = {The evasion of elemental mercury represents a significant pathway for reducing the level of this potentially toxic material in aquatic ecosystems. The evasion rate is controlled by the concentration of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) across the air-water interface, water, and air temperature as well as wind speed. Here we investigate the role of microbial mercury oxidation and reduction in regulating DGM diel patterns in two freshwater lakes, Jack's Lake and Lake Ontario. Three replicate diurnal cycles of DGM in Brookes Bay, Jack's Lake peaked at 313 fM between 9:00 to 10:30 and decreased to 79.6 fM by 16:00. Microbial mercury reductase activity (converts Hg2+ to Hg0) increased with DGM concentrations and mercury oxidase activity (converts Hg0 to Hg2+) increased as DGM concentrations decreased in the mid-afternoon. This illustrates that mercury oxidase activity was linked to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) diurnal patterns. Thirty minutes after spiking Lake Ontario water with H2O2, mercury oxidase activity increased by 250\% and by 60 min, DGM decreased to 28\% of its initial value. Two hours after the H2O2 spike, mercury oxidase activity had declined, but mercury reductase activity and DGM both increased. Four hours after the spike, mercury reductase and DGM levels had returned to original levels. Our results are consistent with the following sequence of events. In the morning, microbial activity produces DGM (in addition to any DGM formed through photoreduction of Hg2+). As photochemically produced H2O2 increases in concentration it induces the biologically mediated decrease in DGM concentrations throughout the afternoon. To predict concentration of DGM in surface waters and flux rates to the atmosphere, the contribution of photoreduction and photooxidation must be placed in context with reduction and oxidation rates due to microbial activity.},

L-1. This picoplankter lacked morphological features useful in discriminating it from other similar sized forms with either phase contrast or epifluorescence light microscopy. Natural populations of picoplankton, obtained from the height of the bloom until its decline, were examined in thin section with transmission electron microscopy. A cell with a single chloroplast, nucleus, and mitochondrion and an unusual exocellular polysaccharide-like layer was apparently the bloom alga. The ultrastructure of this alga is consistent with that of the Chrysophyceae, and a new genus and species, Aureococcus anophagefferens is described. Attempts to grow this previously unrecognized picoplanktonic alga as an obligate phototroph failed and only yielded cultures of other previously described picoalgae. Facultative and obligate phagotrophic protists with ingested cells of Aureococcus were only observed as the bloom waned and minute diatoms became common. Cells of A. anophagefferens with virus particles typical for picoalgae occurred throughout the bloom. Populations of the usually dominant photosynthetic picoplankter, the cyanobacterium Synechococcus N\"ageli, were depressed during the bloom. This could be due in part to selective grazing on Synechococcus rather than Aureococcus by elevated populations of Calycomonas ovalis Wulff which accompanied the algal bloom.},

To address these questions, an FprA has been characterized from the anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The gene encoding this D. vulgaris FprA lies downstream of an operon encoding superoxide reductase and rubredoxin, consistent with an O2-scavenging oxidase function for this FprA. The recombinant D. vulgaris FprA can indeed serve as the terminal component of an NADH oxidase. However, this oxidase turnover results in irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. On the other hand, the recombinant D. vulgaris FprA shows robust anaerobic nitric oxide reductase activity in vitro and also protects a nitric oxide-sensitive Escherichia coli strain against exposure to exogenous nitric oxide. It is, therefore, proposed that this D. vulgaris FprA functions as a scavenging nitric oxide reductase in vivo and that this activity protects D. vulgaris against anaerobic exposure to nitric oxide. The location of a gene encoding a second FprA homologue in the D. vulgaris genome also suggests its involvement in nitrogen oxide metabolism.}

Moreover, the dominant lipid composition found from Isochrysis galbana extractions was palmitic acid (C16:0) at 22.3\%. The high saturated acid of Isochrysis galbana contributed to the improved biodiesel properties because biodiesel quality is influenced by the lipid composition of microalgae species.

  abstract = {The green picoalgal genus Micromonas is broadly distributed in estuaries, coastal marine habitats and open oceans, from the equator to the poles. Phylogenetic, ecological and genomic analyses of culture strains and natural populations have suggested that this cosmopolitan genus is composed of several cryptic species corresponding to genetic lineages. We performed a detailed analysis of variations in morphology, pigment content, and sequences of the nuclear-encoded small-subunit rRNA gene and the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) from strains isolated worldwide. A new morphological feature of the genus, the presence of tip hairs at the extremity of the hair point, was discovered and subtle differences in hair point length were detected between clades. Clear non-homoplasious synapomorphies were identified in the small-subunit rRNA gene and ITS2 spacer sequences of five genetic lineages. These findings lead us to provide emended descriptions of the genus Micromonas, of the type species M. pusilla, and of the recently described species M. commoda, as well as to describe 2 new species, M. bravo and M. polaris. By clarifying the status of the genetic lineages identified within Micromonas, these formal descriptions will facilitate further interpretations of large-scale analyses investigating ecological trends in time and space for this widespread picoplankter.},

Collectively, the enzymes exhibit similar turnover rates with the catalase and peroxidase reactions varying between 4900 and 15,900s-1 and 8\textendash 25s-1, respectively. The seven enzymes also exhibited similar pH optima for the peroxidase (4.25\textendash 5.0) and catalase reactions (5.75), and high sensitivity to azide and cyanide with IC50 values of 0.2\textendash 20{$\mu$}M and 50\textendash 170{$\mu$}M, respectively. The KMs of the enzymes for H2O2 in the catalase reaction were relatively invariant between 3 and 5mM at pH 7.0, but increased to values ranging from 20 to 225mM at pH 5, consistent with protonation of the distal histidine (pKa approximately 6.2) interfering with H2O2 binding to Cpd I. The catalatic kcat was 2- to 3-fold higher at pH 5 compared to pH 7, consistent with the uptake of a proton being involved in the reduction of Cpd I. The turnover rates for the INH lyase and isonicotinoyl-NAD synthase reactions, responsible for the activation of isoniazid as an anti-tubercular drug, were also similar across the seven enzymes, but considerably slower, at 0.5 and 0.002s-1, respectively. Only the NADH oxidase reaction varied more widely between 10-4 and 10-2s-1 with the fastest rate being exhibited by the enzyme from B. pseudomallei.},

Phytoplankton cells are entrained in the water column and are thus often exposed to rapid changes in irradiance within the upper mixed layer of the ocean. An upward fluctuation in irradiance can result in photosystem II photoinactivation exceeding counteracting repair rates through protein turnover, thereby leading to net photoinhibition of primary productivity, and potentially cell death. Here we show that the effective cross-section for photosystem II photoinactivation is conserved across the picocyanobacteria, but that their photosystem II repair capacity and protein-specific photosystem II light capture are negatively correlated and vary widely across the strains. The differences in repair rate correspond to the light and nutrient conditions that characterize the site of origin of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus isolates, and determine the upward fluctuation in irradiance they can tolerate, indicating that photoinhibition due to transient high-light exposure influences their distribution in the ocean.},

Accordingly, the absence of geographical insulation would imply the existence of a relatively small number of microeukaryotic species. To test these ideas, we sequenced and compared several nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genes from the isolates of a marine picoeukaryotic alga ({$\sim$}2 {$\mu$}m), Micromonas pusilla, collected worldwide. Independent and combined phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that this traditional single morphospecies actually comprises several independent lineages, some of which are shown to be ubiquitous in oceans. However, while some lineages group closely related strains, others form distant clusters, revealing the existence of cryptic species. Moreover, molecular dating using a relaxed clock suggests that their first diversification may have started as early as during the Late Cretaceous ({$\sim$}65 MYA), implying that ``M. pusilla'' is the oldest group of cryptic species known to date. Our results illustrate that global dispersal of a picoeukaryote is possible in oceans, but this does not imply a reduced species number. On the contrary, we show that the morphospecies concept is untenable because it overlooks a large genetic and species diversity and may lead to incorrect biological assumptions.},

  abstract = {Watermass stratification has been considered the essential physical condition that dinoflagellates require to bloom because of their relative inability, unlike diatoms, to tolerate the elevated shear-stress associated with water-column mixing, turbulence and high velocity, coastal currents. The swimming speeds of 71 flagellate taxa, with a focus on dinoflagellates, are compared to the turbulence fields and vertical velocities that develop during representative wind conditions, upwelling and at frontal zones. The results suggest that the classical stratification\textendash dinoflagellate bloom paradigm needs revision. Tolerance of turbulence, growth within well-mixed watermasses and survival and dispersal while entrained within current systems are well developed capacities among dinoflagellates. Their secretion of mucous, often copious during blooms, is suggested to be an environmental engineering strategy to dampen turbulence. Biophysical tolerance of turbulence by dinoflagellates is often accompanied by high swimming speeds. Motility speeds of many species exceed in situ vertical current velocities; this also allows diel migrational patterns and other motility-based behavior to persist. Species belonging to ``mixing-drift'' life-form assemblages can increase their swimming speeds through chain formation, which helps to compensate for the increased turbulence and vertical water-column velocities of their habitats. The ability of dinoflagellate species to tolerate the vertical velocities of offshore, frontal zones, where abundant populations often develop, suggests that fronts may serve as ``pelagic seed banks'', occurring as pelagic analogues of nearshore seed beds, from which seed stock is dispersed. The different ecologies associated with the hypothesized, ``pelagic seed banks'' of vegetative cells and the ``seed beds'' of resting stage cells deposited onto sediments are discussed. There is a contradiction in the stratification\textendash HAB paradigm: the quiescent conditions of a stratified watermass, with its characteristic nutrient-poor conditions are expected to promote stasis of the population, rather than growth and blooms. The analyses suggest that dinoflagellate blooms do not preponderate in stratified watermasses because the bloom species are biophysically intolerant of the higher velocities and turbulence of more mixed watermasses. The watermass stratification that often accompanies flagellate blooms is probably a secondary, parallel event and less essential than some other factor(s) in triggering the observed bloom.},

Where next? 1209 Acknowledgements 1209 References 1209 Summary Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced, via superoxide and superoxide dismutase, by electron transport in chloroplasts and mitochondria, plasma membrane NADPH oxidases, peroxisomal oxidases, type III peroxidases and other apoplastic oxidases. Intracellular transport is facilitated by aquaporins and H2O2 is removed by catalase, peroxiredoxin, glutathione peroxidase-like enzymes and ascorbate peroxidase, all of which have cell compartment-specific isoforms. Apoplastic H2O2 influences cell expansion, development and defence by its involvement in type III peroxidase-mediated polymer cross-linking, lignification and, possibly, cell expansion via H2O2-derived hydroxyl radicals. Excess H2O2 triggers chloroplast and peroxisome autophagy and programmed cell death. The role of H2O2 in signalling, for example during acclimation to stress and pathogen defence, has received much attention, but the signal transduction mechanisms are poorly defined. H2O2 oxidizes specific cysteine residues of target proteins to the sulfenic acid form and, similar to other organisms, this modification could initiate thiol-based redox relays and modify target enzymes, receptor kinases and transcription factors. Quantification of the sources and sinks of H2O2 is being improved by the spatial and temporal resolution of genetically encoded H2O2 sensors, such as HyPer and roGFP2-Orp1. These H2O2 sensors, combined with the detection of specific proteins modified by H2O2, will allow a deeper understanding of its signalling roles.},

  abstract = {The large variation in size and shape in diatoms is shown by morphometric measurements of 515 benthic and pelagic diatom species from the Baltic Sea area. The largest mean cell dimension (mostly the apical axis) varied between 4.2 and 653 ?m, cell surface area between 55 and 344,000 ?m2, and cell volume between 21 and 14.2 ? 106?m3. The shape?related index, length to width ratio, was between 1.0 and 63.3 and the shape? and size?related index, surface area to volume ratio, was between 0.02 and 3.13. Diatom community analysis by multivariate statistics is usually based on counts of a fixed number of diatom valves with species scores irrespective of cell size. This procedure underestimates the large species for two reasons. First, the importance of a species with higher cell volume is usually larger in a community. Second, larger species usually have lower abundances and their occurrence in the diatom counts is stochastic. This article shows that co?occurring small and large diatom species can respond very differently to environmental constraints. Large epiphytic diatoms responded most to macroalgal host species and small epiphytic diatoms most to environmental conditions at the sampling site. Large epilithic diatoms responded strongly to salinity, whereas small epilithic diatoms did so less clearly. The conclusion is that different scale?dependent responses are possible within one data set. The results from the test data also show that important ecological information from diatom data can be missed when the large species are neglected or underestimated.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important relatively stable non-radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) is produced by normal aerobic metabolism in plants. At low concentrations, H2O2 acts as a signal molecule involved in the regulation of specific biological/physiological processes (photosynthetic functions, cell cycle, growth and development, plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses). Oxidative stress and eventual cell death in plants can be caused by excess H2O2 accumulation. Since stress factors provoke enhanced production of H2O2 in plants, severe damage to biomolecules can be possible due to elevated and non-metabolized cellular H2O2. Plants are endowed with  H2O2-metabolizing enzymes such as catalases (CAT), ascorbate peroxidases (APX), some peroxiredoxins, glutathione/thioredoxin peroxidases, and glutathione sulfo-transferases. However, the most notably distinguished enzymes are CAT and APX since the former mainly occurs in peroxisomes and does not require a reductant for catalyzing a dismutation reaction. In particular, APX has a higher affinity for H2O2 and reduces it to H2O in chloroplasts, cytosol, mitochondria and peroxisomes, as well as in the apoplastic space, utilizing ascorbate as specific electron donor. Based on recent reports, this review highlights the role of H2O2 in plants experiencing water deficit and salinity and synthesizes major outcomes of studies on CAT and APX activity and genetic regulation in drought- and salt-stressed plants.},

All strains were found to be able to shortly utilize moderate or even high light, but the low-light strains bleached rapidly in moderate light. Measurements of photoinhibition in the presence of the antibiotic lincomycin showed that a low-light Prochlorococcus strain was more sensitive than a high-light strain and both were more sensitive than the marine Synechococcus. The action spectrum of photoinhibition showed an increase from blue to ultraviolet wavelengths in all strains, suggesting contribution of manganese absorption to photoinhibition, but blue light caused less photoinhibition in marine cyanobacteria than expected on the basis of earlier results from plants and cyanobacteria. The visible-light part of the action spectrum resembled the absorption spectrum of the organism, suggesting that photosynthetic antenna pigments, especially divinyl chlorophylls, have a more important role as photoreceptors of visible-light photoinhibition in marine cyanobacteria than in other photoautotrophs.},

In the former, Cytochrome c provides electrons for pumping protons to produce a gradient for ATP synthesis, while in the MCOs the function is the oxidation of substrates, either organic or metal ions. In the MCOs the reduction of O2 is carried out at a trinuclear Cu cluster (TNC). Oxygen intermediates have been trapped which exhibit unique spectroscopic features that reflect novel geometric and electronic structures. These intermediates have both intact and cleaved O-O bonds, allowing the reductive cleavage of the O-O bond to be studied in detail both experimentally and computationally. These studies show that the topology of the TNC provides a unique geometric and electronic structure particularly suited to carry out this key reaction in Nature.},

Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that~this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

Here we describe the discovery of `Lokiarchaeota', a novel candidate archaeal phylum, which forms a monophyletic group with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses, and whose genomes encode an expanded repertoire of eukaryotic signature proteins that are suggestive of sophisticated membrane remodelling capabilities. Our results provide strong support for hypotheses in which the eukaryotic host evolved from a bona fide archaeon, and demonstrate that many components that underpin eukaryote-specific features were already present in that ancestor. This provided the host with a rich genomic `starter-kit' to support the increase in the cellular and genomic complexity that is characteristic of eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {The roles of superoxide (O2\textbullet -), peroxynitrite, and carbon dioxide in the oxidative chemistry of nitric oxide (NO) are reviewed. The formation of peroxynitrite from NO and O2\textbullet - is controlled by superoxide dismutase (SOD), which can lower the concentration of superoxide ions. The concentration of CO2 in vivo is high (ca. 1 mM), and the rate constant for reaction of CO2 with -OONO is large (pH-independent k = 5.8 \texttimes{} 104 M-1s-1). Consequently, the rate of reaction of peroxynitrite with CO2 is so fast that most commonly used scavengers would need to be present at very high, near toxic levels in order to compete with peroxynitrite for CO2. Therefore, in the presence of physiological levels of bicarbonate, only a limited number of biotargets react directly with peroxynitrite. These include heme-containing proteins such as hemoglobin, peroxidases such as myeloperoxidase, seleno-proteins such as glutathione peroxidase, proteins containing zinc-thiolate centers such as the DNA-binding transcription factors, and the synthetic antioxidant ebselen. The mechanism of the reaction of CO2 with -OONO produces metastable nitrating, nitrosating, and oxidizing species as intermediates. An analysis of the lifetimes of the possible intermediates and of the catalysis of peroxynitrite decompositions suggests that the reactive intermediates responsible for reactions with a variety of substrates may be the free radicals NO2 and CO3\textbullet -. Biologically important reactions of these free radicals are, for example, the nitration of tyrosine residues. These nitrations can be pathological, but they also may play a signal transduction role, because nitration of tyrosine can modulate phosphorylation and thus control enzymatic activity. In principle, it might be possible to block the biological effects of peroxynitrite by scavenging the free radicals NO2 and CO3\textbullet -. Because it is difficult to directly scavenge peroxynitrite because of its fast reaction with CO2, scavenging of intermediates from the peroxynitrite/CO2 reaction would provide an additional way of preventing peroxynitrite-mediated cellular effects. The biological effects of peroxynitrite also can be prevented by limiting the formation of peroxynitrite from NO by lowering the concentration of O2\textbullet - using SOD or SOD mimics. Increased formation of peroxynitrite has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, lung injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other diseases.},

Here we show that overexpression of PTOX from the salt-tolerant brassica species Eutrema salsugineum does not, alone, result in activity, but that overexpressing plants show faster induction and a greater final level of PTOX activity once exposed to salt stress. This implies that an additional activation step is required before activity is induced. We show that that activation involves the translocation of the protein from the unstacked stromal lamellae to the thylakoid grana and a protection of the protein from trypsin digestion. This represents an important activation step and opens up possibilities in the search for stress-tolerant crops.},

Species with acquired phototrophy are important components of diversity in aquatic ecosystems, but there are major differences in host and algal taxa involved and in niches of protists with acquired phototrophy in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Organisms that carry out acquired phototrophy are usually mixotrophs, but the degree to which they depend on phototrophy is variable. Evidence suggests that `excess carbon' provided by acquired phototrophy has been important in supporting major evolutionary innovations that are crucial to the current ecological roles of these protists in aquatic ecosystems. Acquired phototrophy occurs primarily among radiolaria, foraminifera, ciliates and dinoflagellates, but is most ecologically important among the first three. Acquired phototrophy in foraminifera and radiolaria is crucial to their contributions to carbonate, silicate, strontium, and carbon flux in subtropical and tropical oceans. Planktonic ciliates with algal kleptoplastids are important in marine and fresh waters, whereas ciliates with green algal endosymbionts are mostly important in freshwaters. The phototrophic ciliate Myrionecta rubra can be a major primary producer in coastal ecosystems. Our knowledge of how acquired phototrophy influences trophic dynamics and biogeochemical cycles is rudimentary; we need to go beyond traditional concepts of `plant' and `animal' functions to progress in our understanding of aquatic microbial ecology. This is a rich area for exploration using a combination of classical and molecular techniques, laboratory and field research, and physiological and ecosystem modeling.},

Initial specific nitrate uptake rates by small (35000 mu-m-3) and large (130000 mu-m-3) cells of the diatom Ditylum brightwellii did not differ significantly. However, the larger cells maintained a high uptake rate for a longer time. Therefore, they accumulated nitrate in a higher biomass-specific pool than the smaller cells. In the dark, this effect was even more pronounced. Two smaller diatom species, Lauderia borealis (7474 mu-m-3) and Thalassiosira pseudonana (98 mu-m-3), had lower initial specific nitrate uptake rates and lower intracellular pools. Transient-state ammonium uptake did not result in accumulation of large intracellular pools of ammonium. Theoretically, and on the basis of the presented results, we stress the dualistic functional role of the vacuole. A large vacuole is an effective way for larger algal species to possess a minimum cell nutrient quota/cell surface ratio which is in the range of smaller species. Furthermore, by functioning as a storage reservoir it reduces inhibition of the uptake rate by cytoplasmic accumulated nutrients. The effect of the latter mechanism is that larger algal species are better at nitrate uptake under fluctuating conditions. These results imply that, in nitrogen-controlled marine systems, resource competition under fluctuating nutrient concentrations can only lead to a shift towards larger phytoplankton species if nitrate rather than ammonium is the main nitrogen source. From theoretical considerations it is argued that the maximum growth rate of algae is determined by nutrient assimilation properties rather than by photosynthetic capacity.},

To a first approximation, microzooplankton consumed all production by phytoplankton {$<$}20 \textmu m in size and nearly half the production by phytoplankton {$>$}20 \textmu m, mainly diatoms. Microzooplankton (ciliate plus heterotrophic dinoflagellate) biomass ranged from 9.6 \textmu g C L-1 to 82.2 \textmu g C L-1. The highest levels were associated with diatom blooms and equaled those previously reported for highly productive coastal upwelling regions. Regulation of microzooplankton grazing differed according to size class. Grazing on phytoplankton {$<$}5 \textmu m in size averaged 0.48 d-1 and was closely correlated with phytoplankton growth rates in the same size class. In contrast, grazing on phytoplankton {$>$}20 \textmu m averaged 0.17 d-1 and was unrelated to phytoplankton growth rate in this size class. Variations in grazing pressure on these largest phytoplankton arose mainly through variations in the biomass of the larger ({$>$}40 \textmu m) ciliates and dinoflagellates. This biomass, in turn, became more closely correlated with {$>$}20 \textmu m chlorophyll as the season progressed, indicating removal of top-down control on these ciliates and dinoflagellates as Neocalanus spp. copepods left the upper water column. Because microzooplankton directly consume much of the phytoplankton production in the CGOA, processes that regulate this trophic linkage have major implications for food web structure and secondary production in this coastal ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton productivity in the polar Southern Ocean (SO) plays an important role in the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean's interior, a process called the biological carbon pump, which helps regulate global climate. SO productivity in turn is limited by low iron, light, and temperature, which restrict the efficiency of the carbon pump. Iron and light can colimit productivity due to the high iron content of the photosynthetic photosystems and the need for increased photosystems for low-light acclimation in many phytoplankton. Here we show that SO phytoplankton have evolved critical adaptations to enhance photosynthetic rates under the joint constraints of low iron, light, and temperature. Under growth-limiting iron and light levels, three SO species had up to sixfold higher photosynthetic rates per photosystem II and similar or higher rates per mol of photosynthetic iron than temperate species, despite their lower growth temperature (3 vs. 18 \textdegree C) and light intensity (30 vs. 40 {$\mu$}mol quanta{$\cdot$}m2{$\cdot$}s-1), which should have decreased photosynthetic rates. These unexpectedly high rates in the SO species are partly explained by their unusually large photosynthetic antennae, which are among the largest ever recorded in marine phytoplankton. Large antennae are disadvantageous at low light intensities because they increase excitation energy loss as heat, but this loss may be mitigated by the low SO temperatures. Such adaptations point to higher SO production rates than environmental conditions should otherwise permit, with implications for regional ecology and biogeochemistry.},

Their diminutive size conceals surprising levels of genetic diversity and defies classical species' descriptions. We present a detailed analysis within the genus Ostreococcus and show that morphological characteristics cannot be used to describe diversity within this group. Karyotypic analyses of the best-characterized species O. tauri show it to carry two chromosomes that vary in size between individual clonal lines, probably an evolutionarily ancient feature that emerged before species' divergences within the Mamiellales. By using a culturing technique specifically adapted to members of the genus Ostreococcus, we purified {$>$}30 clonal lines of a new species, Ostreococcus mediterraneus sp. nov., previously known as Ostreococcus clade D, that has been overlooked in several studies based on PCR-amplification of genetic markers from environment-extracted DNA. Phylogenetic analyses of the S-adenosylmethionine synthetase gene, and of the complete small subunit ribosomal RNA gene, including detailed comparisons of predicted ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer 2) secondary structures, clearly support that this is a separate species. In addition, karyotypic analyses reveal that the chromosomal location of its ribosomal RNA gene cluster differs from other Ostreococcus clades.},

The genome consisted of a circular chromosome 2,696,255 bp long. A total of 2,525 potential protein-coding genes, two sets of rRNA genes, 45 tRNA genes representing 42 tRNA species, and several genes for small stable RNAs were assigned to the chromosome by similarity searches and computer predictions. The translated products of 56\% of the potential protein-coding genes showed sequence similarities to experimentally identified and predicted proteins of known function, and the products of 35\% of the genes showed sequence similarities to the translated products of hypothetical genes. The remaining 9\% of genes lacked significant similarities to genes for predicted proteins in the public DNA databases. Some 139 genes coding for photosynthesis-related components were identified. Thirty-seven genes for two-component signal transduction systems were also identified. This is the smallest number of such genes identified in cyanobacteria, except for marine cyanobacteria, suggesting that only simple signal transduction systems are found in this strain. The gene arrangement and nucleotide sequence of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301 were nearly identical to those of a closely related strain Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, except for the presence of a 188.6 kb inversion.

  abstract = {The microbial cosmopolitan dispersion hypothesis often invoked to explain distribution patterns driven by high connectivity of oceanographic water masses and widespread dispersal ability has never been rigorously tested. By using a global marine bacterial dataset and iterative matrix randomization simulation, we show that marine bacteria exhibit a significantly greater dispersal limitation than predicted by our null model using the ``everything is everywhere'' tenet with no dispersal limitation scenario. Specifically, marine bacteria displayed bipolar distributions (i.e., species occurring exclusively at both poles and nowhere else) significantly less often than in the null model. Furthermore, we observed fewer taxa present in both hemispheres but more taxa present only in a single hemisphere than expected under the null model. Each of these trends diverged further from the null expectation as the compared habitats became more geographically distant but more environmentally similar. Our meta-analysis supported a latitudinal gradient in bacterial diversity with higher richness at lower latitudes, but decreased richness toward the poles. Bacteria in the tropics also demonstrated narrower latitudinal ranges at lower latitudes and relatively larger ranges in higher latitudes, conforming to the controversial macroecological pattern of the ``Rapoport rule.'' Collectively, our findings suggest that bacteria follow biogeographic patterns more typical of macroscopic organisms, and that dispersal limitation, not just environmental selection, likely plays an important role. Distributions of microbes that deliver critical ecosystem services, particularly those in polar regions, may be vulnerable to the same impacts that environmental stressors, climate warming, and degradation in habitat quality are having on biodiversity in animal and plant species.},

  abstract = {To survive, an algal species must maximize its reproduction rate via efficient nutrient acquisition and assimilation while minimizing rates of mortality from grazing or other sources. In a survey of 11 well studied marine algal species (including 3 racial variants of a single species, Emiliania huxleyi) in ammonium-limited cyclostat cultures, we observed variations in ammonium uptake rates and associated growth rates, which were linked to cell size and, apparently, also to grazing defense. The 5 largest species (10\textendash 12 \textmu m cell diameter) had similar low ammonium uptake rates and associated ammonium-limited growth rates owing to diffusion limitation of uptake. Diffusive flux per unit of cell volume decreases with the inverse square of the cell diameter; hence, cells can minimize diffusion limitation and increase nutrient uptake by becoming smaller. However, this comes at the cost of higher susceptibility to grazing mortality. The 7 smallest isolates (2.7\textendash 4.6 \textmu m diameter) had higher rates of ammonium uptake and growth as predicted from theory, but there was considerable variation for similarly sized cells. All 4 of the small algal species or isolates that are known to be poorly grazed or poorly assimilated by grazers had unusually low ammonium uptake rates and associated growth rates for their size, which we hypothesize to be due to the high cost of grazing defense. The results suggest the existence of evolutionary tradeoffs between large cell size and grazing defenses (which decrease grazing mortality) and small size and minimal defenses (which promote growth and reproduction). Such tradeoffs could increase the species diversity of algal communities, which in turn promotes ecosystem stability.Erratum},

Of these regions, the Southern Ocean seems to play the greatest role in the global carbon cycle3,4, but controversy exists as to the dominant controls on net algal production. Limitation by iron deficiency4,5, light availability1,6,7 and grazing by zooplankton2 have been proposed. Here we present the results from culture experiments showing that the amount of cellular iron needed to support growth is higher under lower light intensities, owing to a greater requirement for photosynthetic iron-based redox proteins by low-light acclimatized algae. Moreover, algal iron uptake varies with cell surface area, such that the growth of small cells is favoured under iron limitation, as predicted theoretically8. Phytoplankton growth can therefore be simultaneously limited by the availability of both iron and light. Such a co-limitation may be experienced by phytoplankton in iron-poor regions in which the surface mixed layer extends below the euphotic zone\textemdash as often occurs in the Southern Ocean6,7\textemdash or near the bottom of the euphotic zone in more stratified waters. By favouring the growth of smaller cells, iron/light co-limitation should increase grazing by microzooplankton, and thus minimize the loss of fixed carbon and nitrogen from surface waters in settling particles9,10.},

  abstract = {The balance between sources and sinks of molecular oxygen in the oceans has greatly impacted the composition of Earth's atmosphere since the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, thereby exerting key influence on Earth's climate and the redox state of (sub)surface Earth. The canonical source and sink terms of the marine oxygen budget include photosynthesis, respiration, photorespiration, the Mehler reaction, and other smaller terms. However, recent advances in understanding cryptic oxygen cycling, namely the ubiquitous one-electron reduction of O2 to superoxide by microorganisms outside the cell, remains unexplored as a potential player in global oxygen dynamics. Here we show that dark extracellular superoxide production by marine microbes represents a previously unconsidered global oxygen flux and sink comparable in magnitude to other key terms. We estimate that extracellular superoxide production represents a gross oxygen sink comprising about a third of marine gross oxygen production, and a net oxygen sink amounting to 15 to 50\% of that. We further demonstrate that this total marine dark extracellular superoxide flux is consistent with concentrations of superoxide in marine environments. These findings underscore prolific marine sources of reactive oxygen species and a complex and dynamic oxygen cycle in which oxygen consumption and corresponding carbon oxidation are not necessarily confined to cell membranes or exclusively related to respiration. This revised model of the marine oxygen cycle will ultimately allow for greater reconciliation among estimates of primary production and respiration and a greater mechanistic understanding of redox cycling in the ocean.},

  abstract = {In the marine environment, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide is produced through a diverse array of light-dependent and light-independent reactions, the latter of which is thought to be primarily controlled by microorganisms. Marine superoxide production influences organic matter remineralization, metal redox cycling, and dissolved oxygen concentrations, yet the relative contributions of different sources to total superoxide production remain poorly constrained. Here we investigate the production, steady-state concentration, and particle-associated nature of light-independent superoxide in productive waters off the northeast coast of North America. We find exceptionally high levels of light-independent superoxide in the marine water column, with concentrations ranging from 10 pM to in excess of 2,000 pM. The highest superoxide concentrations were particle associated in surface seawater and in aphotic seawater collected meters off the seafloor. Filtration of seawater overlying the continental shelf lowered the light-independent, steady-state superoxide concentration by an average of 84\%. We identify eukaryotic phytoplankton as the dominant particle-associated source of superoxide to these coastal waters. We contrast these measurements with those collected at an off-shelf station, where superoxide concentrations did not exceed 100 pM, and particles account for an average of 40\% of the steady-state superoxide concentration. This study demonstrates the primary role of particles in the production of superoxide in seawater overlying the continental shelf and highlights the importance of light-independent, dissolved-phase reactions in marine ROS production.},

  abstract = {Planktonic bacteria dominate surface ocean biomass and influence global biogeochemical processes, but remain poorly characterized owing to difficulties in cultivation. Using large-scale single cell genomics, we obtained insight into the genome content and biogeography of many bacterial lineages inhabiting the surface ocean. We found that, compared with existing cultures, natural bacterioplankton have smaller genomes, fewer gene duplications, and are depleted in guanine and cytosine, noncoding nucleotides, and genes encoding transcription, signal transduction, and noncytoplasmic proteins. These findings provide strong evidence that genome streamlining and oligotrophy are prevalent features among diverse, free-living bacterioplankton, whereas existing laboratory cultures consist primarily of copiotrophs. The apparent ubiquity of metabolic specialization and mixotrophy, as predicted from single cell genomes, also may contribute to the difficulty in bacterioplankton cultivation. Using metagenome fragment recruitment against single cell genomes, we show that the global distribution of surface ocean bacterioplankton correlates with temperature and latitude and is not limited by dispersal at the time scales required for nucleotide substitution to exceed the current operational definition of bacterial species. Single cell genomes with highly similar small subunit rRNA gene sequences exhibited significant genomic and biogeographic variability, highlighting challenges in the interpretation of individual gene surveys and metagenome assemblies in environmental microbiology. Our study demonstrates the utility of single cell genomics for gaining an improved understanding of the composition and dynamics of natural microbial assemblages.},

  abstract = {The structure of bovine erythrocyte Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase has been determined to 2 \AA{} resolution using only the larger structure factors beyond 4 \AA. The enzyme crystallizes in space group C2 with two dimeric enzyme molecules per asymmetric unit. All four crystallographically independent subunits were fitted separately to the electron density map at 2 \AA{} resolution on the University of North Carolina GRIP-75 molecular graphics system. Atomic co-ordinates were refined using the Hendrickson \& Konnert (1980) program for stereochemically restrained refinement against structure factors, which allowed the use of non-crystallographic symmetry. The crystallographic residual error for the refined model was 25.5\% with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.03 \AA{} from ideal bond lengths and an average atomic temperature factor of 12 \AA 2. Each enzyme subunit is composed primarily of eight antiparallel {$\beta$} strands that form a flattened cylinder, plus three external loops. The {$\beta$} barrel is asymmetrical and can be viewed as having two distinct sides; {$\beta$} strands 5 to 8 are shorter with fewer hydrogen bonds, less regular side-chain alternation, and greater twist than strands 1 to 4. The main-chain hydrogen bonds primarily link {$\beta$} strand residues; side-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds are extensively involved in the formation of tight turns, which form a major structural element of the three loops. The largest loop includes both a disulfide region and a Zn-liganding region, each of which resembles one of the other two loops in overall structure. The second largest loop includes a short section of {$\alpha$} helix. The smallest loop forms a Greek key connection across one end of the {$\beta$} barrel. The single disulfide bond, which forms a left-handed spiral, covalently joins the largest loop to the beginning of {$\beta$} strand 8. Symmetrically related {$\beta$} bulge pairs fold the two large loops back against the external surface of the {$\beta$} barrel to surround the active channel. The active site Cu(II) and Zn(II) lie 6.3 \AA{} apart at the bottom of this long channel; the Zn is buried, while the Cu is solvent-accessible. The side-chain of His61 forms a bridge between the Cu and Zn and is coplanar with them within the current accuracy of the data. The Cu ligands ND1 of His44 and NE2 of His46, -61 and -118 show an uneven tetrahedral distortion from a square plane. The Cu has a fifth axial coordination position exposed to solvent. Zn ligands ND1 of His61, -69 and -78 and OD1 of Asp81 show tetrahedral geometry with a strong distortion toward a trigonal pyramid having the buried Asp81 at the apex. Both the side-chains and mainchains of the metal-liganding residues are stabilized in their orientation by a complex network of hydrogen bonds.},

  abstract = {Photosystem I (PSI) photoinhibition suppresses plant photosynthesis and growth. However, the mechanism underlying PSI photoinhibition has not been fully clarified. In this study, in order to investigate the mechanism of PSI photoinhibition in higher plants, we applied repetitive short-pulse (rSP) illumination, which causes PSI-specific photoinhibition in chloroplasts isolated from spinach leaves. We found that rSP treatment caused PSI photoinhibition, but not PSII photoinhibition in isolated chloroplasts in the presence of O2. However, chloroplastic superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities failed to protect PSI from its photoinhibition. Importantly, PSI photoinhibition was largely alleviated in the presence of methyl viologen, which stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the stromal region by accepting electrons from PSI, even under the conditions where CuZn-superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities were inactivated by KCN. These results suggest that the ROS production site, but not the ROS production rate, is critical for PSI photoinhibition. Furthermore, we found that not only superoxide (O2 ~-) but also singlet oxygen (1O2) is involved in PSI photoinhibition induced by rSP treatment. From these results, we suggest that PSI photoinhibition is caused by both O2 ~- and 1O2 produced within the thylakoid membranes when electron carriers in PSI become highly reduced. Here, we show, to our knowledge, new insight into the PSI photoinhibition in higher plants.},

In this study, we isolated mutants of the unicellular green alga, Coccomyxa sp. strain Obi, defective in the gene for the large subunit of ATP:{$\alpha$}-d-glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (AGPL) by means of a transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) as follows. First, two expression cassettes encoding left and right arms of TALEN for AGPL mutagenesis were introduced into strain Obi, and from two independent transformants of strain Obi carrying both expression cassettes, seven derivatives bearing different mutations in AGPL were isolated. When these mutants were grown in 1/2-diluted and 1/3-diluted minimal media, their lipid contents were significantly higher than those of their parental strains. The growth in 1/3-diluted medium was similar between the mutants and their parental strains, while the growth in 1/2-diluted medium was significantly lower for the mutants than for their parental strains. The lipid productivity, which is a crucial factor for commercial production of biofuels, was not statistically different between the parental and mutant strains. We concluded that the suppression of starch biosynthesis to increase lipid productivity in microalgae is a risky strategy as it could result in low biomass productivity.},

The Dexter-type superexchange via charge transfer states (Car\textbullet +/O2\textbullet\textendash ) governs the 1O2 quenching. The Car\textbullet +/O2\textbullet\textendash{} states are substantially higher in energy (2\textendash 4 eV) than the initial 1Car/1O2 states. The quantum dynamics calculations indicate an ultrafast 1O2 quenching on a timescale of subpicosecond owing to the strong electronic couplings in the carotenoid/O2 complexes. The superexchange mechanism via the Car\textbullet +/O2\textbullet\textendash{} states dominates the 1O2 quenching, although the direct two-electron coupling can also play a certain role.},

We analyzed the genome and transcriptome of the oleaginous diatom Fistulifera solaris JPCC DA0580. Next-generation sequencing technology provided evidence of an allodiploid genome structure, suggesting unorthodox molecular evolutionary and genetic regulatory systems for reinforcing metabolic efficiencies. Although major metabolic pathways were shared with nonoleaginous diatoms, transcriptome analysis revealed unique expression patterns, such as concomitant upregulation of fatty acid/triacylglycerol biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation ({$\beta$}-oxidation) in concert with ATP production. This peculiar pattern of gene expression may account for the simultaneous growth and oil accumulation phenotype and may inspire novel biofuel production technology based on this oleaginous microalga.},

A recent paper gave the first empirical evidence that colony size increase in P. globosa is a defensive response against grazers, and knowing the signalling mechanism(s) behind this response will thus be a key to understanding the trophodynamics in systems dominated by this species. I conducted experiments with specially designed diffusion incubators, each of which consists of a non-grazing chamber (with P. globosa only) and a grazing chamber (grazers + phytoplankton) connected by 2 {$\mu$}m polycarbonate membrane filters. The results showed that physical contact with grazers was not required to initiate the defensive response; instead, P. globosa colony size increase was found to be stimulated by dissolved chemicals generated by ambient grazing activities. This signal was non-species specific, such that various combinations of three species of grazers and four species of phytoplankton in the grazing chambers all resulted in significant, but different extents of colony enlargement in P. globosa in the non-grazing chambers (30\textendash 300\% larger than the `grazer-free' control). High concentrations of ambient solitary P. globosa cells and other phytoplankton seemed to suppress colony enlargement in P. globosa, and grazers would help reduce this inhibition by removing the ambient solitary P. globosa cells and other phytoplankton. These non-species-specific mechanisms would allow P. globosa to regulate colony size development and defend itself in diverse planktonic systems, which may help to explain the global success of this species.},

The O2 concentrations in air-saturated phosphate-buffered salt solutions were monitored by measuring the decay of phosphorescence from a Pd phosphor in solution; the decay rate was obtained by fitting the tail of the phosphorescence intensity profile to an exponential. For glucose oxidation in the presence of glucose oxidase, the rate constant determined for the rate-limiting step was k {$\frac{1}{4}$} (3.0 5 0.7) \^A104 M\`A1s\`A1 at 37 C. For catalase-catalyzed H2O2 breakdown, the reaction order in [H2O2] was somewhat greater than unity at 37 C and well above unity at 25 C, suggesting different temperature dependences of the rate constants for various steps in the reaction. The two reactions were combined in a single experiment: addition of glucose oxidase to glucose-rich cell-free media caused a rapid drop in [O2], and subsequent addition of catalase caused [O2] to rise and then decrease to zero. The best fit of [O2] to a kinetic model is obtained with the rate constants for glucose oxidation and peroxide decomposition equal to 0.116 s\`A1 and 0.090 s\`A1 respectively. Cellular respiration in the presence of glucose was found to be three times as rapid as that in glucose-deprived cells. Added NaCN inhibited O2 consumption completely, confirming that oxidation occurred in the cellular mitochondrial respiratory chain.},

M-CC-190 as salt-tolerant and cv. IL-111 as salt-sensitive cultivars) under normal and different concentrations of NaCl. The pH profile of GP activity in leaves extract of two cultivars in control and salt stressed plants showed different pattern of pH dependency with three maxima peaks at pH 4.5, 6.5 and 8 in salt-tolerant cultivar and two maxima peaks at pH 4.5 and 6.5 in salt-sensitive cultivar. Comparison of catalytic efficiency for GP between two cultivars at respective pH, showed that, salt-tolerant cultivar in both control and salt stressed conditionhad higher catalytic efficiency than salt-susceptible cultivar. The GP activity on the gels revealed four and two isoforms of peroxidases in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cultivars, respectively. GPs increased their expression with higher levels of salinity. However, in salt-sensitive cultivar GPs expression exhibited threshold behavior, with increase expressions in isoenzymes up to a certain level of salinity (25 mM NaCl), followed by decrease to a level of expressions corresponding to the control groups. The levels of lipid peroxidation as indicated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were higher in the sensitive variety than the tolerant under control and NaCl salinity. The overall results obtained in this study suggest that, oxidative stress may play an important role in salt-stressedsafflower plants and that the greater protection of M-CC-190 leaves from salt-induced oxidative damage results, at least in part, through the increase of the GPs activity, catalytic efficiency and induction of specific isoenzymes (P1 and P4).Key words: Safflower, guaiacol peroxidase, kinetics, isoenzymes, salt stress.},

  abstract = {The genus Prochlorococcus is globally abundant and dominates the total phytoplankton biomass and production in the oligotrophic ocean. The single species, Prochlorococcus marinus, comprises six named ecotypes. Our aim was to analyze the taxonomic structure of the genus Prochlorococcus. We analyzed the complete genomes of 13 cultured P. marinus type and reference strains by means of several genomic taxonomy tools (i.e., multilocus sequence analysis, amino acid identity, Karlin genomic signature, and genome to genome distance). In addition, we estimated the diversity of Prochlorococcus species in over 100 marine metagenomes from all the major oceanic provinces. According to our careful taxonomic analysis, the 13 strains corresponded, in fact, to ten different Prochlorococcus species. This analysis establishes a new taxonomic framework for the genus Prochlorococcus. Further, the analysis of the metagenomic data suggests that, in total, there may only be 35 Prochlorococcus species in the world's oceans. We propose that the dearth of species observed in this study is driven by high selective pressures that limit diversification in the global ocean.}

  abstract = {Adhesion of raphid diatoms to surfaces, mediated by the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), is an important strategy for growth and survival. Diatom biofilms are also important in the context of biofouling. Diatoms exhibit selectivity in adhering to surfaces, but little is understood about how they perceive the properties of a substratum and translate that perception into altered adhesion properties. In this study, we demonstrate that Seminavis robusta Danielidis et D. G. Mann, like many other pennate diatoms, adheres more strongly to hydrophobic surfaces (such as silicone elastomer foul-release coatings) than to hydrophilic surfaces. To explore the cellular mechanisms that may underlie this selectivity, we tested the hypothesis that diatoms may perceive a hydrophilic surface as unconducive to adhesion through a form of stress response involving nitric oxide (NO) production. Single-cell imaging with the fluorescent indicator DAF-FM DA (4-amino-5-methylamino-2{${'}$},7{${'}$}-difluorofluorescein diacetate), revealed NO levels that were 4-fold higher in cells adhered to a hydrophilic surface (acid-washed glass) compared with a hydrophobic surface (polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, PDMSE). Elevated levels of NO caused by the addition of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) did not affect growth, but cells showed reduced adhesion strength to both glass and PDMSE. Addition of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMMA) caused a small but significant increase in adhesion strength. Overall, the results suggest that NO acts as a signal of the wettability properties of substrata for Seminavis.},

Cells and cysts of the Davis isolate (FL1B) were morphologically indistinguishable from P. glacialis, and comparison of the large subunit rDNA of both cultures demonstrated only 0.2\% sequence divergence over 1366 base pairs. The photosynthetic pigments of P. glacialis (strains FL1B and CCMP 1383) were typical of dinoflagellates, with peridinin (contributing up to 31\%) as the major accessory pigment. Extremely high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, up to 76.3\%) were characteristic of P. glacialis isolate FL1B. The high PUFA concentration of this species is thought to be an adaptation to survive the cold temperatures of the upper fast ice. The sterol profile of FL1B was atypical of dinoflagellates, with 4-desmethylsterols (up to 79\%) in greater abundance than 4{$\alpha$}-methyl sterols (up to 24\%). 27-Nor-24-methylcholest-5,22E-dien-3{$\beta$}-ol was identified as the principle sterol in P. glacialis, contributing up to 64\% of the total sterol composition.},

  abstract = {Extremes in salinity and temperature and high levels of incident ultraviolet radiation  (UVR) characterise the brine pockets and channels of upper Antarctic fast ice. Data  on the composition and distribution of the microbial community inhabiting this  environment is limited. Furthermore, how this community tolerates the immoderate  physical and chemical parameters of the upper ice brine is poorly understood.  The microbial community in the Davis upper fast ice consists of cryo- and  halotolerant autotrophic flagellates, a few diatoms, one ciliate species and several  heterotrophic species. Small autotrophic dinoflagellates and chrysophytes dominate a  community containing greater flagellate diversity than previously reported. A  cryptomonad and two species of Pyramimonas are reported for the first time.  The abundant dinoflagellate of Davis fast ice, identified using molecular taxonomy, is  Polarella glacialis Montresor et al. Observations of P. glacialis in this study from  fast and pack ice brine samples along the East Antarctic coastline, with others from  the literature, indicate that this species has a circumpolar distribution. The perfect  match between the large subunit ribosomal RNA sequences of the Davis and  McMurdo Sound P. glacialis strains suggests a single Antarctica population of this  species.  The Davis fast ice brine community shows a remarkable resemblance to that of  McMurdo Sound. The dominant taxa of the Davis ice, P. glacialis and the  chrysophytes, are abundant in McMurdo Sound. These similarities point to at least a  disparate distribution of this community throughout Antarctic fast ice. \_However, the  probable circumpolar occurrence of P. glacialis and similar taxa from other coastal  regions indicate a more continuous fast ice distribution.  For the first time, P. glacialis is described in terms of its pigments and lipids. The  extremely high polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of this species (up to 76\%)  most likely enhances its tolerance of the cold brine environment. The sterol profile of  P. glacialis is atypical of dinoflagellates and is dominated by the 4-desmethylsterol, 27-nor-24-methylcholest-5,22E-3B-ol. This sterol is rare in other dinoflagellates and  unknown in other algal classes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for P. glacialis  in the environment. Sediment records of this biomarker may prove useful in  determining past Antarctic climate change and fast ice extent.  The upper fast ice of Davis Station is characterised by extreme and transitory  salinities and temperatures over the spring-summer transition. Salinities decrease  from 96 to 2.5 psu whilst temperatures increase from -4.5 to -0.3 \textdegree C. These  parameters and the relatively high UVR environment of the upper ice are identified as  major ecophysiological stresses in the brine channels.  The osmoregulatory and cryoprotectant role of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP)  in P. glacialis and the Davis fast ice community are investigated in the field and the  laboratory. DMSP concentrations in the brine (450 to 230 nM) decrease in linear  proportion to salinity and temperature, implicating DMSP as a possible osmolyte and  cryoprotectant. In laboratory studies,. P. glacialis cultures produce up to 47 fM  DMSP cell-1. However, under salinity upshock, no clear relationship between DMSP  production and salinity is evident. Under the nitrogen replete culture conditions used  here, DMSP is not considered a primary osmolyte in P. glacialis.  The effects of UV radiation (280 - 400 nm) on the brine community are assessed in  situ using spectral perturbation methods. Under the conditions of this experiment,  UV-B radiation (280 - 320 nm) inhibited chl a production within the upper ice whilst  UV-A (320 - 400nm) appeared to have little effect. All UV radiation retarded the  growth of P. glacialis asexual cells, however it is not possible to differentiate  between the effects of UV-A and UV-B. DMSP concentrations within the brine are  reduced under the influence of UV-A alone. UV absorbing compounds, with  absorption. spectra between 310 and 335 nm, are evident in the brine. As light  perturbation did not show trends in the accumulation of these compounds, it is  concluded that the UV absorbing compounds present are not photoinducible.},

However, our knowledge about its production and consumption pathways in oceanic environments is rudimentary. In order to decipher the major factors affecting NO photochemical production, we irradiated several artificial seawater samples as well as 31 natural surface seawater samples in laboratory experiments. The seawater samples were collected during a cruise to the western tropical North Pacific Ocean (WTNP, a N\textendash S section from 36 to 2{$\smwhtcircle$} N along 146 to 143{$\smwhtcircle$} E with 6 and 12 stations, respectively, and a W\textendash E section from 137 to 161{$\smwhtcircle$} E along the Equator with 13 stations) from November 2015 to January 2016. NO photoproduction rates from dissolved nitrite in artificial seawater showed increasing trends with decreasing pH, increasing temperature, and increasing salinity. In contrast, NO photoproduction rates (average: 0.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 \texttimes{} 10-12 mol L-1 s-1) in the natural seawater samples from the WTNP did not show any correlations with pH, water temperature, salinity, or dissolved inorganic nitrite concentrations. The flux induced by NO photoproduction in the WTNP (average: 13\texttimes 10-12 mol m-2 s-1) was significantly larger than the NO air\textendash sea flux density (average: 1.8 \texttimes{} 10-12 mol m-2 s-1), indicating a further NO loss process in the surface layer.},

Although the rate of H2O2 decomposition was about 30 times lower in the {$\Delta$}katG mutant than in the wild type, the strain had a normal phenotype and its doubling time as well as its resistance to H2O2 and methyl viologen were indistinguishable from those of the wild type. The residual H2O2-scavenging capacity was more than sufficient to deal with the rate of H2O2 production by the cell, estimated to be less than 1\% of the maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport in vivo. We propose that catalase-peroxidase has a protective role against environmental H2O2 generated by algae or bacteria in the ecosystem (for example, in mats). This protective role is most apparent at a high cell density of the cyanobacterium. The residual H2O2-scavenging activity in the {$\Delta$}katG mutant was a light-dependent peroxidase activity. However, neither glutathione peroxidase nor ascorbate peroxidase accounted for a significant part of this H2O2-scavenging activity. When a small thiol such as dithiothreitol was added to the medium, the rate of H2O2 decomposition in the {$\Delta$}katG mutant increased more than 10-fold, indicating that a thiol-specific peroxidase, for which thioredoxin may be the physiological electron donor, is present. Oxidized thioredoxin is likely to be reduced again by photosynthetic electron transport. Therefore, under laboratory conditions, there are only two enzymatic mechanisms for H2O2 decomposition present in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. One is catalyzed by a catalase-peroxidase, and the other is catalyzed by thiol-specific peroxidase.},

Like all photosynthetic organisms, their use of light for energy and reducing power creates the challenge of avoiding cellular damage. To better understand the interplay between redox balance and organic matter secretion, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of Thalassiosira pseudonana strain CCMP 1335, a model for diatom molecular biology and physiology, with a 60-year history of studies. The model simulates the metabolic activities of 1,432 genes via a network of 2,792 metabolites produced through 6,079 reactions distributed across six subcellular compartments. Growth was simulated under different steady-state light conditions (5\textendash 200 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1) and in a batch culture progressing from exponential growth to nitrate-limitation and nitrogen-starvation. We used the model to examine the dissipation of reductants generated through light-dependent processes and found that when available, nitrate assimilation is an important means of dissipating reductants in the plastid; under nitrate-limiting conditions, sulfate assimilation plays a similar role. The use of either nitrate or sulfate uptake to balance redox reactions leads to the secretion of distinct organic nitrogen and sulfur compounds. Such compounds can be accessed by bacteria in the surface ocean. The model of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana provides a mechanistic explanation for the production of ecologically and climatologically relevant compounds that may serve as the basis for intricate, cross-kingdom microbial networks. Diatom metabolism has an important influence on global biogeochemistry; metabolic models of marine microorganisms link genes to ecosystems and may be key to integrating molecular data with models of ocean biogeochemistry.},

LB795, apparently by causing the alga to produce H2O2. H2O2 inhibited acetylene reduction when added to cultures at concentrations greater than 10 {$\mu$}M. As catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) is not present in Gloeocapsa sp. LB795, H2O2 is probably removed by a non-enzymic reaction with ascorbate and also by an enzyme-catalysed reaction with glutathione. Enzymes catalysing the decomposition of H2O2, were most active in young cells which were therefore better able than old cells to metabolize H2O2 produced in the presence of methyl viologen. The maximum activities of these enzymes coincided with maximum nitrogenase activity during the growth of batch cultures, and may provide a protective mechanism for nitrogenase.},

We developed a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry-based quantitative method that allowed us to discriminate between free radical (type I)- and singlet oxygen (1O2; type II)-mediated lipid peroxidation (LPO) signatures by using hydroxy fatty acids as specific reporters. Using this method, we observed that in nonphotosynthesizing Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) tissues, nonenzymatic LPO was almost exclusively catalyzed by free radicals both under normal and oxidative stress conditions. However, in leaf tissues under optimal growth conditions, 1O2 was responsible for more than 80\% of the nonenzymatic LPO. In Arabidopsis mutants favoring 1O2 production, photooxidative stress led to a dramatic increase of 1O2 (type II) LPO that preceded cell death. Furthermore, under all conditions and in mutants that favor the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (two sources for type I LPO reactions), plant cell death was nevertheless always preceded by an increase in 1O2-dependent (type II) LPO. Thus, besides triggering a genetic cell death program, as demonstrated previously with the Arabidopsis fluorescent mutant, 1O2 plays a major destructive role during the execution of reactive oxygen species-induced cell death in leaf tissues.},

Increased peroxynitrite formation has been related to the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, thus underlining the importance of understanding the mechanisms of its detoxification. In nature, different enzymatic routes for peroxynitrite decomposition have evolved. Among them, peroxiredoxins catalytically reduce peroxynitrite in vitro; modulation of their expression affects peroxynitritemediated cytotoxicity, and their content changes in pathologic conditions associated with increased peroxynitrite formation in vivo, thus indicating a physiologic role of these enzymes in peroxynitrite reduction. Selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase also catalyzes peroxynitrite reduction, but its role in vivo is still a matter of debate. In selected cellular systems, heme proteins also play a role in peroxynitrite detoxification, such as its isomerization by oxyhemoglobin in red blood cells. Moreover, different pharmacologic approaches have been used to decrease the toxicity related to peroxynitrite formation. Manganese or iron porphyrins catalyze peroxynitrite decomposition, and their protective role in vivo has been confirmed in biologic systems. Glutathione peroxidase mimetics also rapidly reduce peroxynitrite, but their biologic role is less well established. Flavonoids, nitroxides, and tyrosine-containing peptides decreased peroxynitrite-mediated toxicity under different conditions, but their mechanism of action is indirect. Antioxid.

Even though O2-\textbullet{} is not a strong oxidant, it is a precursor of most other reactive oxygen species, and it also becomes involved in the propagation of oxidative chain reactions. Despite the presence of various antioxidant defences, the mitochondrion appears to be the main intracellular source of these oxidants. This review describes the main mitochondrial sources of reactive species and the antioxidant defences that evolved to prevent oxidative damage in all the mitochondrial compartments. We also discuss various physiological and pathological scenarios resulting from an increased steady state concentration of mitochondrial oxidants.},

The extracellular matrix of most members of the Rhodophyta and Viridiplantae consists of carbohydrate-based or a highly glycosylated protein-based cell wall while the Glaucophyte covering is poorly resolved. In order to elucidate possible evolutionary links between the three advanced lineages in Archaeplastida, a genomic analysis was initiated. Fully sequenced genomes from the Rhodophyta and Virideplantae and the well-defined CAZy database on glycosyltransferases were included in the analysis. The number of glycosyltransferases found in the Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta are generally much lower then in land plants (Embryophyta). Three specific features exhibited by land plants increase the number of glycosyltransferases in their genomes: (1) cell wall biosynthesis, the more complex land plant cell walls require a larger number of glycosyltransferases for biosynthesis, (2) a richer set of protein glycosylation, and (3) glycosylation of secondary metabolites, demonstrated by a large proportion of family GT1 being involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In a comparative analysis of polysaccharide biosynthesis amongst the taxa of this study, clear distinctions or similarities were observed in (1) N-linked protein glycosylation, i.e., Chlorophyta has different mannosylation and glucosylation patterns, (2) GPI anchor biosynthesis, which is apparently missing in the Rhodophyta and truncated in the Chlorophyta, (3) cell wall biosynthesis, where the land plants have unique cell wall related polymers not found in green and red algae, and (4) O-linked glycosylation where comprehensive orthology was observed in glycosylation between the Chlorophyta and land plants but not between the target proteins.},

Within this clade, two deeply branching lineages of Prochlorococcus, two lineages of marine A Synechococcus and one lineage of marine B Synechococcus exhibit closely spaced divergence points with low bootstrap support. This pattern is consistent with a near-simultaneous diversification of marine lineages with divinyl chlorophyll b and phycobilisomes as photosynthetic antennae. Inferences from 16S ribosomal RNA sequences including data for 18 marine picophytoplankton clade members were congruent with results of psbB and petB and D sequence analyses focusing on five strains of Prochlorococcus and one strain of marine A Synechococcus. Third codon position and intergenic region nucleotide frequencies vary widely among members of the marine picophytoplankton group, suggesting that substitution biases differ among the lineages. Nonetheless, standard phylogenetic methods and newer algorithms insensitive to such biases did not recover different branching patterns within the group, and failed to cluster Prochlorococcus with chloroplasts or other chlorophyll b-containing prokaryotes. Prochlorococcus isolated from surface waters of stratified, oligotrophic ocean provinces predominate in a lineage exhibiting low G + C nucleotide frequencies at highly variable positions.},

ROS are highly reactive molecules and in excessive amounts, can lead to protein and DNA oxidation, protein cross-linking, and cell death. Cell-culture models provide a valuable tool in understanding the mechanisms that lead to cell death. Accumulation of ROS within cells and/or their release into the culture media are highly cell type-specific. The ability to estimate ROS levels in the culture media is an important step in understanding the mechanisms contributing to disease processes. In this paper, we describe the optimization of a simple method to estimate ROS levels in the culture media using the Acridan Lumigen PS-3 reagent provided in the Amersham ECL Plus kit (GE Healthcare, UK). We have shown that the Acridan Lumigen PS-3 assay generates ROS-specific chemiluminescence in fresh as well as media stored at -20\textdegree C, in as little as 10\textendash 20 {$\mu$}l of samples. The method was able to detect the dose (of stimulants)- and time (acute and chronic)-dependent changes in ROS levels in media collected from various cell types. Our results suggest that the kit reagents, PBS buffer, and various media did not contribute significantly to the overall chemiluminescence generated in the assay; however, we suggest that the unused medium specific for each cell type should be used as blanks and final readings of test samples normalized against these readings. As this method uses commonly available laboratory equipment and commercially available reagents, we believe this assay is convenient, economical, and specific in estimating ROS released extracellularly into the culture media.},

  abstract = {Significance: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), important signaling molecules in plants, are involved in developmental control and stress adaptation. ROS production can trigger broad transcriptional changes; however, it is not clear how specificity in transcriptional regulation is achieved. Recent Advances: A large collection of public transcriptome data from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is available for analysis. These data can be used for the analysis of biological processes that are associated with ROS signaling and for the identification of suitable transcriptional indicators. Several online tools, such as Genevestigator and Expression Angler, have simplified the task to analyze, interpret, and visualize this wealth of data. Critical Issues: The analysis of the exact transcriptional responses to ROS requires the production of specific ROS in distinct subcellular compartments with precise timing, which is experimentally difficult. Analyses are further complicated by the effect of ROS production in one subcellular location on the ROS accumulation in other compartments. In addition, even subtle differences in the method of ROS production or treatment can lead to significantly different outcomes when various stimuli are compared. Future Directions: Due to the difficulty of inducing ROS production specifically with regard to ROS type, subcellular localization, and timing, we propose that the concept of a ``ROS marker gene'' should be re-evaluated. We suggest guidelines for the analysis of transcriptional data in ROS signaling. The use of ``ROS signatures,'' which consist of a set of genes that together can show characteristic and indicative responses, should be preferred over the use of individual marker genes. Antioxid.

The PLAZA platform consists of multiple independent instances focusing on different plant clades, while also providing access to a consistent set of reference species. Each PLAZA instance contains structural and functional gene annotations, gene family data and phylogenetic trees and detailed gene colinearity information. A user-friendly web interface makes the necessary tools and visualizations accessible, specific for each data type. Here we present PLAZA 4.0, the latest iteration of the PLAZA framework. This version consists of two new instances (Dicots 4.0 and Monocots 4.0) providing a large increase in newly available species, and offers access to updated and newly implemented tools and visualizations, helping users with the ever-increasing demands for complex and in-depth analyzes. The total number of species across both instances nearly doubles from 37 species in PLAZA 3.0 to 71 species in PLAZA 4.0, with a much broader coverage of crop species (e.g. wheat, palm oil) and species of evolutionary interest (e.g. spruce, Marchantia). The new PLAZA instances can also be accessed by a programming interface through a RESTful web service, thus allowing bioinformaticians to optimally leverage the power of the PLAZA platform.},

The measurement of transcriptome-wide gene expression has convincingly switched from microarrays to sequencing in a matter of years. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a quantitative and open system for profiling transcriptional outcomes on a large scale and therefore facilitates a large diversity of applications, including basic science studies, but also agricultural or clinical situations. In the past 10 years or so, much has been learned about the characteristics of the RNA-seq data sets, as well as the performance of the myriad of methods developed. In this review, we give an overview of the developments in RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design, with an explicit focus on the quantification of gene expression and statistical approachesfor differential expression. We also highlight emerging data types, such as single-cell RNA-seq and gene expression profiling using long-read technologies.},

They are often associated with the seasonal sea-ice environment. Pyramimonas gelidicola (McFadden, Moestrup \& Wetherbee, 1982) was isolated from the water column of a saline Antarctic lake, and observations on the organism's life history as it grew in unialgal cultures were made. The alga proved to be pleomorphic: capable of producing several morphologically distinct life stages. We recorded motile single-celled quadriflagellates that formed two statistically distinct size classes, a rare uniflagellate cell-type, and aggregations of quadriflagellate cells, multilobed forms and an encystment stage. Multilobed forms and cell aggregations, never before observed in an Antarctic Pyramimonas species, are presumed to be growth medium-induced morphotypes. Multilobed forms contained an equal number of nuclei and lobes, suggesting that they are the product of asexual reproduction. Some of the morphotypes we report here may never be observed under natural field conditions, but the potential for this alga to alternate between morphotypes is clearly demonstrated.},

Apart from homologous gene families, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, Gene Ontology, InterPro and text-mining functional annotations, different interactive viewers are available to study genome organization using gene collinearity and synteny information. Different search functions, documentation pages, export functions and an extensive glossary are available to guide non-expert scientists. To illustrate the versatility of the platform, different case studies are presented demonstrating how pico-PLAZA can be used to functionally characterize large-scale EST/RNA-Seq data sets and to perform environmental genomics. Functional enrichments analysis of 16 Phaeodactylum\,tricornutum transcriptome libraries offers a molecular view on diatom adaptation to different environments of ecological relevance. Furthermore, we show how complementary genomic data sources can easily be combined to identify marker genes to study the diversity and distribution of algal species, for example in metagenomes, or to quantify intraspecific diversity from environmental strains.},

While respiratory carbon oxidation pathways, electron transport, and ATP turnover are tightly coupled processes, AOX provides a means to relax this coupling, thus providing a degree of metabolic homeostasis to carbon and energy metabolism. Beside their role in primary metabolism, plant mitochondria also act as ``signaling organelles'', able to influence processes such as nuclear gene expression. AOX activity can control the level of potential mitochondrial signaling molecules such as superoxide, nitric oxide and important redox couples. In this way, AOX also provides a degree of signaling homeostasis to the organelle. Evidence suggests that AOX function in metabolic and signaling homeostasis is particularly important during stress. These include abiotic stresses such as low temperature, drought, and nutrient deficiency, as well as biotic stresses such as bacterial infection. This review provides an introduction to the genetic and biochemical control of AOX respiration, as well as providing generalized examples of how AOX activity can provide metabolic and signaling homeostasis. This review also examines abiotic and biotic stresses in which AOX respiration has been critically evaluated, and considers the overall role of AOX in growth and stress tolerance.},

Ascertaining the scale, scope and generality of this hypothesis is important for both development of ecological theory and aquatic ecosystem management10. Although small-scale tests of parts of this cascade are common11\textendash 15, whole-lake assessments are not, particularly in large, natural lakes9; also the influence of several trophic levels and nutrients, a requisite for unambiguous interpretation of predator effects, has not been considered. Here we present data from a natural experiment in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, which support the cascading trophic interactions hypothesis. Massive mortality of fish greatly reduced pr\'Edation on zooplankton, resulting in an increase in the abundance of large Daphnia, and a dramatic decrease in phytoplankton biomass. Physical factors and concentrations of limiting nutrients were unchanged before and after fish mortality, indicating that these factors probably did not cause the observed decrease in phytoplankton. Our results demonstrate strong food web influences on phytoplankton, and support the idea that food web interactions can be managed to reduce phytoplankton abundance.},

Study of the functional role of chemical signaling within phytoplankton assemblages is still in its infancy although recent reports in diatoms suggest the existence of chemical-based defense strategies. Here, we demonstrate how the accurate perception of diatom-derived reactive aldehydes can determine cell fate in diatoms. In particular, the aldehyde (2E,4E/Z)-decadienal (DD) can trigger intracellular calcium transients and the generation of nitric oxide (NO) by a calcium-dependent NO synthase-like activity, which results in cell death. However, pretreatment of cells with sublethal doses of aldehyde can induce resistance to subsequent lethal doses, which is reflected in an altered calcium signature and kinetics of NO production. We also present evidence for a DD\textendash derived NO-based intercellular signaling system for the perception of stressed bystander cells. Based on these findings, we propose the existence of a sophisticated stress surveillance system in diatoms, which has important implications for understanding the cellular mechanisms responsible for acclimation versus death during phytoplankton bloom successions., Aldehydes released by marine diatoms trigger intracellular calcium transients and nitric oxide generation, which results in cell death.},

Here, the author summarizes the current state of understanding, which concerns the role of charge recombination reactions in photodamage and photoprotection. The main mechanism of photodamage induced by visible light appears to be mediated by acceptor side modifications, which develop under light intensity conditions when the capacity of light-independent photosynthetic processes limits the utilization of electrons produced in the initial photoreactions. This situation facilitates triplet chlorophyll formation and singlet oxygen production in the reaction center of PSII, which initiates the damage of electron transport components and protein structure. This mechanism is an important, but not exclusive, pathway of photodamage, and light-induced inactivation of the Mn cluster of water oxidation may occur in parallel with the singlet oxygen-dependent pathway.},

  abstract = {The reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX) was first identified in the membrane of phagocytic cells. For many years, its only known role was in immune defense, where its ROS production leads to the destruction of pathogens by the immune cells. NOX from phagocytes catalyzes, via one-electron trans-membrane transfer to molecular oxygen, the production of the superoxide anion. Over the years, six human homologs of the catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase were found: NOX1, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2. Together with the NOX2/gp91phox component present in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase assembly itself, the homologs are now referred to as the NOX family of NADPH oxidases. NOX are complex multidomain proteins with varying requirements for assembly with combinations of other proteins for activity. The recent structural insights acquired on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic NOX open new perspectives for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms inherent to NOX regulation and ROS production (superoxide or hydrogen peroxide). This new structural information will certainly inform new investigations of human disease. As specialized ROS producers, NOX enzymes participate in numerous crucial physiological processes, including host defense, the post-translational processing of proteins, cellular signaling, regulation of gene expression, and cell differentiation. These diversities of physiological context will be discussed in this review. We also discuss NOX misregulation, which can contribute to a wide range of severe pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, lung fibrosis, cancer, or neurodegenerative diseases, giving this family of membrane proteins a strong therapeutic interest.},

  abstract = {Amplitude- and frequency-modulated waves of Ca2+ ions transmit information inside cells. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), specifically hydrogen peroxide, have been proposed to have a similar role in plant cells. We consider the feasibility of such an intracellular communication system in view of the physical and biochemical conditions in plant cells. As model system, we use a H2O2 signal originating at the plasma membrane (PM) and spreading through the cytosol. We consider two maximally simple types of signals, isolated pulses and harmonic oscillations. First we consider the basic limits on such signals as regards signal origin, frequency, amplitude, and distance. Then we establish the impact of ROS-removing enzymes on the ability of H2O2 to transmit signals. Finally, we consider to what extent cytoplasmic streaming distorts signals. This modeling allows us to predict the conditions under which diffusion-mediated signaling is possible. We show that purely diffusive transmission of intracellular information by H2O2 over a distance of 1\,{$\mu$}m (typical distance between organelles, which may function as relay stations) is possible at frequencies well above 1\,Hz, which is the highest frequency observed experimentally. This allows both frequency and amplitude modulation of the signal. Signaling over a distance of 10\,{$\mu$}m (typical distance between the PM and the nucleus) may be possible, but requires high signal amplitudes or, equivalently, a very low detection threshold. Furthermore, at this longer distance a high rate of enzymatic degradation is required to make signaling at frequencies above 0.1\,Hz possible. In either case, cytoplasmic streaming does not seriously disturb signals. We conclude that although purely diffusion-mediated signaling without relaying stations is theoretically possible, it is unlikely to work in practice, since it requires a much faster enzymatic degradation and a much lower cellular background concentration of H2O2 than observed experimentally.},

  abstract = {Unicellular marine algae have promise for providing sustainable and scalable biofuel feedstocks, although no single species has emerged as a preferred organism. Moreover, adequate molecular and genetic resources prerequisite for the rational engineering of marine algal feedstocks are lacking for most candidate species. Heterokonts of the genus Nannochloropsis naturally have high cellular oil content and are already in use for industrial production of high-value lipid products. First success in applying reverse genetics by targeted gene replacement makes Nannochloropsis oceanica an attractive model to investigate the cell and molecular biology and biochemistry of this fascinating organism group. Here we present the assembly of the 28.7 Mb genome of N. oceanica CCMP1779. RNA sequencing data from nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-depleted growth conditions support a total of 11,973 genes, of which in addition to automatic annotation some were manually inspected to predict the biochemical repertoire for this organism. Among others, more than 100 genes putatively related to lipid metabolism, 114 predicted transcription factors, and 109 transcriptional regulators were annotated. Comparison of the N. oceanica CCMP1779 gene repertoire with the recently published N. gaditana genome identified 2,649 genes likely specific to N. oceanica CCMP1779. Many of these N. oceanica\textendash specific genes have putative orthologs in other species or are supported by transcriptional evidence. However, because similarity-based annotations are limited, functions of most of these species-specific genes remain unknown. Aside from the genome sequence and its analysis, protocols for the transformation of N. oceanica CCMP1779 are provided. The availability of genomic and transcriptomic data for Nannochloropsis oceanica CCMP1779, along with efficient transformation protocols, provides a blueprint for future detailed gene functional analysis and genetic engineering of Nannochloropsis species by a growing academic community focused on this genus.},

They can be cultivated in phototrophic conditions, using sunlight as the sole energy source. Some diatoms, however, can also grow in a mixotrophic mode, wherein both light and external reduced carbon contribute to biomass accumulation. In this study, we investigated the consequences of mixotrophy on the growth and metabolism of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using glycerol as the source of reduced carbon. Transcriptomics, metabolomics, metabolic modelling and physiological data combine to indicate that glycerol affects the central-carbon, carbon-storage and lipid metabolism of the diatom. In particular, provision of glycerol mimics typical responses of nitrogen limitation on lipid metabolism at the level of triacylglycerol accumulation and fatty acid composition. The presence of glycerol, despite provoking features reminiscent of nutrient limitation, neither diminishes photosynthetic activity nor cell growth, revealing essential aspects of the metabolic flexibility of these microalgae and suggesting possible biotechnological applications of mixotrophy.

  abstract = {Aim of this study was to expose phytoplankton to growth conditions simulating deep winter convection in the North Atlantic and thereby to assess changes in physiology enabling their survival. Growth rate, biochemical composition, and photosynthetic activity of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii were determined under two different light scenarios over a temperature range of 5\textendash 15\textdegree C to simulate conditions experienced by cells during winter deep convection. These metrics were examined under a low light scenario (20 \textmu mol m-2 s-1, 12/12 h light/dark), and compared with a scenario of short light pulses of a higher light intensity (120 \textmu mol m-2 s-1, 2/22 h light/dark). Both experimental light conditions offered the same daily light dose. No growth was observed at temperatures below 8\textdegree C. Above 8\textdegree C, growth rates were significantly higher under low light conditions compared with those of short pulsed light exposures, indicating a higher efficiency of light utilization. This could be related to (i) a higher content of Chl a per cell in the low light trial and/or (ii) a more efficient transfer of light energy into growth as indicated by constantly low carbohydrate levels. In contrast, pulsed intense light led to an accumulation of carbohydrates, which were catabolized during the longer dark period for maintaining metabolism. Light curves measured via Chl a fluorescence indicated low light assimilation for the algae exposed to short pulsed light. We postulate that our trial with short light pluses did not provide sufficient light to reach full light saturation. In general, photosynthesis was more strongly affected by temperature under pulsed light than under low light conditions. Our results indicate that model estimates of primary production in relation to deep convection, which are based on average low light conditions, not considering vertical transportation of algae will lead to an overestimation of in situ primary production.}

H2O2 is a signaling molecule that partakes in immune responses where its transport is mediated by aquaporins. To shed further light on the molecular basis of the aquaporin function in H2O2 transport, we have characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana aquaporin, AtPIP2;4, recombinantly produced to high yields in Pichia pastoris. Here, we present a newly established assay that allows detection of H2O2 transport by purified aquaporins reconstituted into liposomes, enabling us to compare aquaporin homologues with respect to substrate specificity. To get additional insight into the structural determinants for aquaporin-mediated H2O2 transport, we solved the 3D-structure of AtPIP2;4 to 3.7\,\AA{} resolution and found structural identity to the water channel from spinach (SoPIP2;1), with the difference that Cd2+ cation is not required to retain the closed conformation. The transport specificities of the two plant aquaporins were compared to a human homologue, AQP1. Overall, we conclude that AtPIP2;4, SoPIP2;1 and hAQP1 are all transporters of both H2O and H2O2, but have different efficiencies for various specificities. Notably, all three homologues expedite H2O transport equally well while the plant aquaporins are more permeable to H2O2 than hAQP1. Comparison of the structures indicates that the observed variations in H2O and H2O2 transport cannot be explained by differences in the monomeric pore. Possibly, the determinants for transport specificities reside in the flexible domains outside the membrane core of these channels.},

This review examines the sources of shear stress in different cultivation systems, shear stress tolerance of different microalgal species and the physiological factors and environmental conditions that may affect shear sensitivity, and potential approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of shear stress. In general, green algae have the greatest tolerance to shear stress, followed by cyanobacteria, haptophytes, red algae, and diatoms, with dinoflagellates comprising the most shear-sensitive species. The shear-sensitivity of microalgae is determined primarily by cell wall strength, cell morphology and the presence of flagella. Turbulence, eddy size, and viscosity are the most prominent parameters affecting shear stress to microalgal cells during cultivation.},

The results showed that only (+)-catechin (CA) and pyrogallic acid (PA) could induce ROS formation in Microcystis aeruginosa and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. 25mgL-1 CA caused 1.2, 1.4 and 1.8 times increase of ROS levels in M. aeruginosa at 1, 2 and 4h exposure, respectively, and, correspondingly in P. subcapitata cells, these values were 3.7, 6.2 and 7.7, respectively. PA also significantly increased the levels of intracellular ROS in P. subcapitata (P{$<$}0.01); however, significant ROS generation in M. aeruginosa was observed at only 4h exposure (P{$<$}0.01). Light enhanced ROS generation in CA treated cells, but not in the cells treated with PA. CA and PA may act as redox cyclers after uptake by test organisms and produce ROS successively. These results suggest that the oxidative stress induced by the redox cycling property of allelochemicals may be one of the important causes for the inhibitory effect of some submerged macrophytes towards undesired phytoplankton in natural aquatic ecosystems.},

The past decade has witnessed significant progress in ROS imaging at levels of intact cells, whole organs or tissues, and even live organisms. In particular, major advances include the development of novel synthetic or genetically encoded fluorescent protein-based ROS indicators, the use of protein indicator-expressing animal models, and the advent of in vivo imaging technology. Innovative ROS imaging has led to important discoveries in ROS signaling\textemdash for example, mitochondrial superoxide flashes as elemental ROS signaling events and hydrogen peroxide transients for wound healing. This review aims at providing an update of the current status in ROS imaging, while identifying areas of insufficient knowledge and highlighting emerging research directions.},

  abstract = {Microalgal strains for algal biofuels production in outdoor ponds will need to have high net growth rates under diverse environmental conditions. A small, variable salinity pond in the San Elijo Lagoon estuary in southern California was chosen to serve as a model pond due to its routinely high chlorophyll content. Profiles of microalgal assemblages from water samples collected from April 2011 to January 2012 were obtained by constructing 18S rDNA environmental clone libraries. Pond assemblages were found to be dominated by green algae Picochlorum sp. and Picocystis sp. throughout the year. Pigment analysis suggested that the two species contributed most of the chlorophyll a of the pond, which ranged from 21.9 to 664.3 {$\mu$}g {$\cdot$} L-1 with the Picocystis contribution increasing at higher salinities. However, changes of temperature, salinity or irradiance may have enabled a bloom of the diatom Chaetoceros sp. in June 2011. Isolates of these microalgae were obtained and their growth rates characterized as a function of temperature and salinity. Chaetoceros sp. had the highest growth rate over the temperature test range while it showed the most sensitivity to high salinity. All three strains showed the presence of lipid bodies during nitrogen starvation, suggesting they have potential as future biofuels strains.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress (OS) has been implicated in various degenerative diseases in aging. In an attempt to quantify OS in a cell model, we examined OS induced by incubating for 30 min with various free radical generators in PC12 cells by using the dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay, modified for use by a fluorescent microplate reader. The nonfluorescent fluorescin derivatives (dichlorofluorescin, DCFH), after being oxidized by various oxidants, will become DCF and emit fluorescence. By quantifying the fluorescence, we were able to quantify the OS. Our results indicated that the fluorescence varied linearly with increasing concentrations (between 0.1 and 1 mM) of H2O2 and 2,2'-azobios(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH; a peroxyl radical generator). By contrast, the fluorescence varied as a nonlinear response to increasing concentrations of 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1; a peroxynitrite generator), sodium nitroprusside (SNP; a nitric oxide generator), and dopamine. Dopamine had a biphasic effect; it decreased the DCF fluorescence, thus acting as an antioxidant, at concentrations {$<$}500 microM in cells, but acted as a pro-oxidant by increasing the fluorescence at 1 mM. While SNP was not a strong pro-oxidant, SIN-1 was the most potent pro-oxidant among those tested, inducing a 70 times increase of fluorescence at a concentration of 100 microM compared with control. Collectively, due to its indiscriminate nature to various free radicals, DCF can be very useful in quantifying overall OS in cells, especially when used in conjunction with a fluorescent microplate reader. This method is reliable and efficient for evaluating the potency of pro-oxidants and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidants against OS in cells.},

Many microalgae can photoreduce oxygen using the Mehler reaction driven by PSI, which could protect PSII.

Exposure to excess light (1,000~{$\mu$}mol~photons~{$\cdot~$}m-2~{$\cdot~$}s-1) produced similar decreases in the operating quantum efficiency of PSII (Fq{${'}$}/Fm{${'}$}) of low light (LL)- and HL-grown N. epithemoides, whereas HL-grown T. pseudonana exhibited much smaller decreases in Fq{${'}$}/Fm{${'}$} than LL-grown cells. HL-grown T. pseudonana and N. epithemioides exhibited greater superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production, higher activities (in T. pseudonana) of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and increased expression of three SOD- and one APX-encoding genes after 60~min of excess light compared to LL-grown cells.

Results indicated that mean cell diameter of Prochlorococcus (0.60~{$\mu$}m) was the smallest, and then followed by Synechococcus (0.98~{$\mu$}m) and picoeukaryotic phytoplankton (1.05~{$\mu$}m). Thereafter, the biomass converted by abundance reached 0.64~{$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}C{$\cdot$}L-1 for Prochlorococcus, 0.34~{$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}C{$\cdot$}L-1 for Synechococcus, and 0.20~{$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}C{$\cdot$}L-1 for picoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Additionally, the distinct biomass contribution of picophytoplankton appeared to be affected by abundance, but not changes in cellular size. Vertically, the cellular sizes of picophytoplankton were remarkably small in upper waters, which was predominantly controlled by the nutrient availability. In contrast, they were larger in deeper waters, which was primarily attributed to the combined effects of low temperature and reduced light availability. Spatially, under the influence of high nutrient concentration induced by the different circulations and coastal upwelling, slightly high carbon biomass of picophytoplankton was observed around the coastal zones of Sri Lanka island and Sumatra, as well as the southern Bay of Bengal.},

Cyanothece 51142 performs oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, separating these two incompatible processes temporally within the same cell, while concomitantly accumulating metabolic products in inclusion bodies that are later mobilized as part of a robust diurnal cycle. The 5,460,377-bp Cyanothece 51142 genome has a unique arrangement of one large circular chromosome, four small plasmids, and one linear chromosome, the first report of a linear element in the genome of a photosynthetic bacterium. On the 429,701-bp linear chromosome is a cluster of genes for enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism, suggesting an important role for the linear chromosome in fermentative processes. The annotation of the genome was significantly aided by simultaneous global proteomic studies of this organism.

  abstract = {Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an enzyme co-factor in eukaryotes that also plays a critical role in protecting photosynthetic eukaryotes against damaging reactive oxygen species derived from the chloroplast. Many animal lineages, including primates, have become ascorbate auxotrophs due to the loss of the terminal enzyme in their biosynthetic pathway, l-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO). The alternative pathways found in land plants and Euglena use a different terminal enzyme, l-galactonolactone dehydrogenase (GLDH). The evolutionary processes leading to these differing pathways and their contribution to the cellular roles of ascorbate remain unclear. Here we present molecular and biochemical evidence demonstrating that GULO was functionally replaced with GLDH in photosynthetic eukaryote lineages following plastid acquisition. GULO has therefore been lost repeatedly throughout eukaryote evolution. The formation of the alternative biosynthetic pathways in photosynthetic eukaryotes uncoupled ascorbate synthesis from hydrogen peroxide production and likely contributed to the rise of ascorbate as a major photoprotective antioxidant., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06369.001, Animals, plants, algae and other eukaryotic organisms all need vitamin C to enable many of their enzymes to work properly. Vitamin C also protects plant and algal cells from damage by molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be produced when these cells harvest energy from sunlight in a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs inside structures called chloroplasts, and has evolved on multiple occasions in eukaryotes when non-photosynthetic organisms acquired chloroplasts from other algae and then had to develop improved defences against ROS., There are several steps involved in the production of vitamin C. In many animals, an enzyme called GULO carries out the final step by converting a molecule known as an aldonolactone into vitamin C; this reaction also produces ROS as a waste product. The GULO enzyme is missing in humans, primates and some other groups of animals, so these organisms must get all the vitamin C they need from their diet., Plants and algae use a different enzyme\textemdash called GLDH\textemdash to make vitamin C from aldonolactone. GLDH is very similar to GULO, but it does not produce ROS as a waste product. It is not clear how the different pathways have evolved, or why some animals have lost the ability to make their own vitamin C., Here, Wheeler et al. used genetics and biochemistry to investigate the evolutionary origins of vitamin C production in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. This investigation revealed that although GULO is missing from the insects and several other groups of animals, it is present in the sponges and many other eukaryotes. This suggests that GULO evolved in early eukaryotic organisms and has since been lost by the different groups of animals. On the other hand, GLDH is only found in plants and the other eukaryotes that can photosynthesize., Wheeler et al.'s findings suggest that GULO has been lost and replaced by GLDH in all plants and algae following their acquisition of chloroplasts. GDLH allows plants and algae to make vitamin C without also producing ROS, which could explain why vitamin C has been able to take on an extra role in these organisms. The results allow us to better understand the functions of vitamin C in photosynthetic organisms and the processes associated with the acquisition of chloroplasts during evolution., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06369.002},

  abstract = {Summary The process of photosynthesis is considered as an oxidation-reduction reaction activated by light absorbed by chlorophyll or certain other substances (e.g., phycocyanin, fucoxanthol), resulting in the evolution of oxygen from water and in the formation of reduced carbon compounds (e.g., carbohydrate) from carbon dioxide. The organisation of the reaction in the cell is not yet understood-the poor photosynthetic activity of light absorbed by chlorophyll in certain red algae may be indicative of a change in this organisation. When chloroplasts are isolated from the cell they are able to catalyse the photochemical reduction of certain hydrogen acceptors with evolution of oxygen from water, but they are unable to reduce carbon dioxide. Analysis of the path of carbon in the green plant cell, both in the light and in the dark, has been made possible by the use of radioactive carbon dioxide. A large number of intermediates in the metabolism of the cell have been identified, but as yet convincing evidence regarding the specific part played by any of these compounds in a particular metabolic process is lacking. The metabolic system of the cell may be analysed in terms of a number of separate processes, but it seems probable that these may have many steps in common. The reactions which must be unique to photosynthesis are those reactions involving at most two light quanta per hydrogen atom transferred which result in the formation of a hydrogen donor capable of reducing carbon dioxide. Comparative studies of the rate of photosynthesis and of the rate of individual steps, as represented for example by the chloroplast reaction and by tracer studies, present the most promising approach to the physiology of photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Motility in cyanobacteria is useful for purposes that range from seeking out favourable light environments to establishing symbioses with plants and fungi. No known cyanobacterium is equipped with flagella, but a diverse range of species is able to `glide' or `twitch' across surfaces. Cyanobacteria with this capacity range from unicellular species to complex filamentous forms, including species such as Nostoc punctiforme, which can generate specialised motile filaments called hormogonia. Recent work on the model unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has shown that its means of propulsion has much in common with the twitching motility of heterotrophs such as Pseudomonas and Myxococcus. Movement depends on Type IV pili, which are extended, adhere to the substrate and then retract to pull the cell across the surface. Previous work on filamentous cyanobacteria suggested a very different mechanism, with movement powered by the directional extrusion of polysaccharide from pores close to the cell junctions. Now a new report by Khayatan and colleagues in this issue of Molecular Microbiology suggests that the motility of Nostoc hormogonia has much more in common with Synechocystis than was previously thought. In both cases, polysaccharide secretion is important for preparing the surface, but the directional motive force comes from Type IV pili.},

Rainwater hydrogen peroxide concentrations in general correlated positively with the pollutant components (hydrogen ion, nitrate and non-seasalt sulfate). This pattern suggests that destruction of hydrogen peroxide by sulfur dioxide is not the dominant factor controlling the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in this rainwater, with the possible exception of winter rain from coastal storms where an inverse correlation between hydrogen peroxide and nonseasalt sulfate was observed. Sequential sampling indicates rapid production of hydrogen peroxide and incorporation into rain within time periods of hours during summer daytime rains.},

We have investigated the effects of UV-B radiation on plant proteins and have observed a novel 66-kD protein. This product was formed in vivo when Brassica napus L. plants grown for 21 d in 65 [mu]mol m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation were subsequently exposed to 65 [mu]mol m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation plus UV-B radiation (1.5 [mu]mol m-2 s-1). The protein appeared after 4 h of UV-B irradiation and accumulated during the next 16 h in UV-B. The 66-kD protein cross-reacted with an antiserum against the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) holoenzyme. Analysis of soluble leaf proteins revealed that the 66-kD product had a number of isoforms corresponding closely to those of the large subunit of Rubisco (LSU). Partial proteolytic digests of the LSU and the 66-kD protein resulted in an equivalent pattern of protein fragments, leading to the conclusion that the 66-kD protein was a photomodified form of the LSU. A similar high molecular mass variant of Rubisco was observed in soluble protein extracts from leaves of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants treated in vivo with UV-B, suggesting that it might be a common product, at least among C3 plants. It is interesting that the 66-kD product appears to be generated after incorporation of the LSU into holoenzyme complexes. This conclusion was drawn from two lines of evidence. First, the LSU variant co-purified with holoenzyme complexes isolated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Second, a UV-B-specific 66-kD protein did not accumulate in a tobacco mutant that synthesizes the Rubisco subunits but does not assemble them into normal holoenzyme complexes.},

  abstract = {Background Small molecule fluorescent probes are vital tools for monitoring reactive oxygen species in cells. Scope of review The types of probe available, the extent to which they are specific or quantitative and complications in interpreting results are discussed. Major conclusions Most commonly used probes (e.g. dihydrodichlorofluorescein, dihydrorhodamine) have some value in providing information on changes to the redox environment of the cell, but they are not specific for any one oxidant and the response is affected by numerous chemical interactions and not just increased oxidant generation. These probes generate the fluorescent end product by a free radical mechanism, and to react with hydrogen peroxide they require a metal catalyst. Probe radicals can react with oxygen, superoxide, and various antioxidant molecules, all of which influence the signal. Newer generation probes such as boronates act by a different mechanism in which nucleophilic attack by the oxidant on a blocking group releases masked fluorescence. Boronates react with hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, hypochlorous acid and in some cases superoxide, so are selective but not specific. They react with hydrogen peroxide very slowly, and kinetic considerations raise questions about how the reaction could occur in cells. General significance Data from oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probes can provide some information on cellular redox activity but is widely misinterpreted. Recently developed non-redox probes show promise but are not generally available and more information on specificity and cellular reactions is needed. We do not yet have probes that can quantify cellular production of specific oxidants.

  abstract = {Exposure of cells to sublethal oxidative stress results in the modulation of various signaling pathways. Oxidants can activate and inactivate transcription factors, membrane channels, and metabolic enzymes, and regulate calcium-dependent and phosphorylation signaling pathways. Oxidation and reduction of thiol proteins are thought to be the major mechanisms by which reactive oxidants integrate into cellular signal transduction pathways. This review focuses on mechanisms for sensing and transmitting redox signals, from the perspective of their chemical reactivity with specific oxidants. We discuss substrate preferences for different oxidants and how the kinetics of these reactions determines how each oxidant will react in a cell. This kinetic approach helps to identify initial oxidant-sensitive targets and elucidate mechanisms involved in transmission of redox signals. It indicates that only those proteins with very high reactivity, such as peroxiredoxins, are likely to be direct targets for hydrogen peroxide. Other more modestly reactive thiol proteins such as protein tyrosine phosphatases are more likely to become oxidized by an indirect mechanism. The review also examines oxidative changes observed during receptor-mediated signaling, the strengths and limitations of detection methods for reactive oxidant production, and the evidence for hydrogen peroxide acting as the second messenger. We discuss areas where observations in cell systems can be rationalized with the reactivity of specific oxidants and where further work is needed to understand the mechanisms involved.},

Thus, the intracellular accumulation of ROS may not only disrupt the functions of specific tissues and organs but also lead to the premature death of the entire organism. Less severe increases in ROS levels may lead to the nonlethal oxidation of fundamental cellular components, such as proteins, phospholipids, and DNA, hence exerting a mutagenic effect that promotes oncogenesis and tumor progression. Here, we describe the use of chemical probes for the rapid detection of ROS in intact and permeabilized adherent cells by fluorescence microscopy and fluorometry. Moreover, after discussing the limitations described in the literature for the fluorescent probes presented herein, we recommend methods to assess the production of specific ROS in various fields of investigation, including the study of oncometabolism.},

Of the four known SOD isoforms, distinguished by their metal cofactor (iron, manganese [Mn], copper/zinc, nickel), MnSOD is the dominant form in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We cloned the MnSOD gene, sodA, using the expression vector pBAD, overexpressed the product in Escherichia coli, and purified the mature protein (TpMnSOD). This recombinant enzyme was used to generate a polyclonal antibody in rabbit that recognizes MnSOD in T. pseudonana. Based on quantitative immunoblots, we calculate that in vivo concentrations of TpMnSOD are approximately 0.9 amol cell-1 using the recombinant protein as a standard. Immunogold staining indicates that TpMnSOD is localized in the chloroplasts, which is in contrast to most other eukaryotic algae (including chlorophytes and embryophytes) where MnSOD is localized exclusively in mitochondria. Based on the photosynthetic Mn complex in photosystem II, cellular Mn budgets cannot account for 50\% to 80\% of measured Mn within diatom cells. Our results reveal that chloroplastic MnSOD accounts for 10\% to 20\% of cellular Mn, depending on incident light intensity and cellular growth rate. Indeed, our analysis indicates that TpMnSOD accounts for 1.4\% ({$\pm$}0.2\%) of the total protein in the cell. The TpMnSOD has a rapid turnover rate with an apparent half-life of 6 to 8 h when grown under continuous light. TpMnSOD concentrations increase relative to chlorophyll, with an increase in incident light intensity to minimize photosynthetic oxidative stress. The employment of a Mn-based SOD, linked to photosynthetic stress in T. pseudonana, may contribute to the continued success of diatoms in the low iron regions of the modern ocean.},

Based on metal cofactors, four known metalloforms of SOD enzymes have been identified: they contain either Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn, or Ni. Orthologs of all metalloforms are present in oxygenic photoautotrophs. The expression of SOD is highly regulated, with specific metalloforms playing an inducible protective role for specific cellular compartments. The various metalloforms of SOD are not distributed equally within either cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae. Typically, cyanobacteria contain either an NiSOD alone or combinations of Mn and Ni or Fe and Mn metalloforms (CuZn is rare among the cyanobacteria). The bacillariophytes and rhodophytes retain an active MnSOD, whereas the chlorophytes, haptophytes, and embryophytes have either FeSOD or multiple combinations of Fe, Mn, and CuZnSODs. The NiSOD is a relatively novel SOD and has been generally excluded from evolutionary analyses. In both cyanobacteria and chlorophyte algae, the FeSOD metalloform appears to be associated with PSI, where its primary role is most likely to deactivate reactive oxygen produced by the Mehler reaction. The CuZnSOD also appears to be associated with the plastid but is phylogenetically more restricted in its distribution. In eukaryotic algae, SODs are all nuclear encoded and, based on nucleotide sequence, protein structures, and phylogenetic distributions, appear to have unique evolutionary histories arising from the lateral gene transfer of three distinct genes to the nucleus after the endosymbiotic acquisition of mitochondria and plastids. The varied phylogenetic histories and subcellular localizations suggest significantly different selection on these SOD metalloforms after the endosymbiont organelle-to-host gene transfer.},

  abstract = {The eukaryotic phylum Apicomplexa encompasses thousands of obligate intracellular parasites of humans and animals with immense socio-economic and health impacts. We sequenced nuclear genomes of Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis, free-living non-parasitic photosynthetic algae closely related to apicomplexans. Proteins from key metabolic pathways and from the endomembrane trafficking systems associated with a free-living lifestyle have been progressively and non-randomly lost during adaptation to parasitism. The free-living ancestor contained a broad repertoire of genes many of which were repurposed for parasitic processes, such as extracellular proteins, components of a motility apparatus, and DNA- and RNA-binding protein families. Based on transcriptome analyses across 36 environmental conditions, Chromera orthologs of apicomplexan invasion-related motility genes were co-regulated with genes encoding the flagellar apparatus, supporting the functional contribution of flagella to the evolution of invasion machinery. This study provides insights into how obligate parasites with diverse life strategies arose from a once free-living phototrophic marine alga., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06974.001, Single-celled parasites cause many severe diseases in humans and animals. The apicomplexans form probably the most successful group of these parasites and include the parasites that cause malaria. Apicomplexans infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, reptiles, birds, and insects, and often have complicated life cycles. For example, the malaria-causing parasites spread by moving from humans to female mosquitoes and then back to humans., Despite significant differences amongst apicomplexans, these single-celled parasites also share a number of features that are not seen in other living species. How and when these features arose remains unclear. It is known from previous work that apicomplexans are closely related to single-celled algae. But unlike apicomplexans, which depend on a host animal to survive, these algae live freely in their environment, often in close association with corals., Woo et al. have now sequenced the genomes of two photosynthetic algae that are thought to be close living relatives of the apicomplexans. These genomes were then compared to each other and to the genomes of other algae and apicomplexans. These comparisons reconfirmed that the two algae that were studied were close relatives of the apicomplexans., Further analyses suggested that thousands of genes were lost as an ancient free-living algae evolved into the apicomplexan ancestor, and further losses occurred as these early parasites evolved into modern species. The lost genes were typically those that are important for free-living organisms, but are either a hindrance to, or not needed in, a parasitic lifestyle. Some of the ancestor's genes, especially those that coded for the building blocks of flagella (structures which free-living algae use to move around), were repurposed in ways that helped the apicomplexans to invade their hosts. Understanding this repurposing process in greater detail will help to identify key molecules in these deadly parasites that could be targeted by drug treatments. It will also offer answers to one of the most fascinating questions in evolutionary biology: how parasites have evolved from free-living organisms., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06974.002},

In order to measure these dynamics, precise tools that can specifically examine the relevant ROS are required. Recent advancements in methodologies for ROS measurement have allowed the study of ROS biology at a level of precision previously unachievable. Here, we discuss improvements to fluorescent ROS dye technologies, genetically encoded ROS reporters, nanoparticle delivery systems, and nanotube ROS probes.

Photosynthetic marine picoeukaryotes in the genus Micromonas thrive in ecosystems ranging from tropical to polar and could serve as sentinel organisms for biogeochemical fluxes of modern oceans during climate change. These broadly distributed primary producers belong to an anciently diverged sister clade to land plants. Although Micromonas isolates have high 18S ribosomal RNA gene identity, we found that genomes from two isolates shared only 90\% of their predicted genes. Their independent evolutionary paths were emphasized by distinct riboswitch arrangements as well as the discovery of intronic repeat elements in one isolate, and in metagenomic data, but not in other genomes. Divergence appears to have been facilitated by selection and acquisition processes that actively shape the repertoire of genes that are mutually exclusive between the two isolates differently than the core genes. Analyses of the Micromonas genomes offer valuable insights into ecological differentiation and the dynamic nature of early plant evolution.},

Diatoms now dominate the eukaryotic oceanic phytoplankton, in part through their exploitation of environments with variable light. We grew marine diatoms across a range of temperatures and then analyzed their PSII function and subunit turnover during an increase in light to mimic an upward mixing event. The small diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana initially responds to increased photoinactivation under blue or white light with rapid acceleration of the photosystem II (PSII) repair cycle. Increased red light provoked only modest PSII photoinactivation but triggered a rapid clearance of a subpool of PsbA. Furthermore, PsbD and PsbB content was greater than PsbA content, indicating a large pool of partly assembled PSII repair cycle intermediates lacking PsbA. The initial replacement rates for PsbD (D2) were, surprisingly, comparable to or higher than those for PsbA (D1), and even the supposedly stable PsbB (CP47) dropped rapidly upon the light shift, showing a novel aspect of rapid protein subunit turnover in the PSII repair cycle in small diatoms. Under sustained high light, T. pseudonana induces sustained nonphotochemical quenching, which correlates with stabilization of PSII function and the PsbA pool. The larger diatom Coscinodiscus radiatus showed generally similar responses but had a smaller allocation of PSII complexes relative to total protein content, with nearly equal stiochiometries of PsbA and PsbD subunits. Fast turnover of multiple PSII subunits, pools of PSII repair cycle intermediates, and photoprotective induction of nonphotochemical quenching are important interacting factors, particularly for small diatoms, to withstand and exploit high, fluctuating light.},

  abstract = {Nanomaterial properties differ from those bulk materials of the same composition, allowing them to execute novel activities. A possible downside of these capabilities is harmful interactions with biological systems, with the potential to generate toxicity. An approach to assess the safety of nanomaterials is urgently required. We compared the cellular effects of ambient ultrafine particles with manufactured titanium dioxide (TiO2), carbon black, fullerol, and polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs). The study was conducted in a phagocytic cell line (RAW 264.7) that is representative of a lung target for NPs. Physicochemical characterization of the NPs showed a dramatic change in their state of aggregation, dispersibility, and charge during transfer from a buffered aqueous solution to cell culture medium. Particles differed with respect to cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under biotic and abiotic conditions. Spontaneous ROS production was compared by using an ROS quencher (furfuryl alcohol) as well as an NADPH peroxidase bioelectrode platform. Among the particles tested, ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) and cationic PS nanospheres were capable of inducing cellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage. Although active under abiotic conditions, TiO2 and fullerol did not induce toxic oxidative stress. While increased TNF-{$\alpha$} production could be seen to accompany UFP-induced oxidant injury, cationic PS nanospheres induced mitochondrial damage and cell death without inflammation. In summary, we demonstrate that ROS generation and oxidative stress are a valid test paradigm to compare NP toxicity. Although not all materials have electronic configurations or surface properties to allow spontaneous ROS generation, particle interactions with cellular components are capable of generating oxidative stress.},

Green algae are known to generally perform C3 photosynthesis, but recent metabolic labeling and genome sequencing data suggest that they may also perform C4 photosynthesis, so C4 photosynthesis might be more wide-spread than previously anticipated. Both C3 and C4 photosynthesis genes were found in U. prolifera by transcriptome sequencing. We also discovered the key enzymes of C4 metabolism based on functional analysis, such as pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK). To investigate whether the alga operates a C4-like pathway, the expression of rbcL and PPDK and their enzyme activities were measured under various forms and intensities of stress (differing levels of salinity, light intensity, and temperature). The expression of rbcL and PPDK and their enzyme activities were higher under adverse circumstances. However, under conditions of desiccation, the expression of rbcL and ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) activity was lower, whereas that of PPDK was higher. These results suggest that elevated PPDK activity may alter carbon metabolism and lead to a partial operation of C4-type carbon metabolism in U. prolifera, probably contributing to its wide distribution and massive, repeated blooms in the Yellow Sea.},

Catalase, which is involved in the degradation of H2O2 into water and oxygen, is the major H2O2-scavenging enzyme in all aerobic organisms. A close interaction exists between intracellular H2O2 and cytosolic calcium in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Studies indicate that an increase in cytosolic calcium boosts the generation of H2O2. Here we report that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous calcium-binding protein, binds to and activates some plant catalases in the presence of calcium, but calcium/CaM does not have any effect on bacterial, fungal, bovine, or human catalase. These results document that calcium/CaM can down-regulate H2O2 levels in plants by stimulating the catalytic activity of plant catalase. Furthermore, these results provide evidence indicating that calcium has dual functions in regulating H2O2 homeostasis, which in turn influences redox signaling in response to environmental signals in plants.},

Their animal counterparts contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in numerous pathologies and here we examined these enzymes as potential sources of ROS in plants. Novel in-gel assay techniques and Moco sulfurase mutants, lacking a sulfur ligand in their Moco active center, were employed to demonstrate that the native tomato and Arabidopsis XDHs are capable of producing O, but not H2O2, while the animal counterpart was shown to produce both, O and H2O2. Superoxide production was dependent on Moco sulfuration when using hypoxanthine/xanthine but not NADH as substrates. The activity was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a suicide inhibitor of FAD containing enzymes. Analysis of XDH in an Arabidopsis Atxdh1 T-DNA insertion mutant and RNA interference lines revealed loss of O activity, providing direct molecular evidence that plant XDH generates superoxides. Contrary to XDH, AO activity produced only H2O2 dissimilar to native animal AO, that can produce O as well. Surprisingly, H2O2 accumulation was not sensitive to DPI. Plant ROS production and transcript levels of AO and XDH were rapidly upregulated by application of abscisic acid and in water-stressed leaves and roots. These results, supported by in vivo measurement of ROS accumulation, indicate that plant AO and XDH are possible novel sources for ROS increase during water stress.},

  abstract = {Among phytoplankton the diatoms are strong competitors and contribute significantly to total global primary production. Aspects of their life history, notably their high sinking rates, make them important to the export flux of carbon into the ocean interior. Unlike the majority of other phytoplankton, they utilize silicic acid (=silicate) to construct their cell walls and are controlled by its availability and distribution. Here a simple model is developed to study the relationship between the diatoms and the ocean's silicon cycle. The ecological component of this model pits the slightly superior diatoms against all other algae, with both groups competing for phosphate while the diatoms additionally require silicic acid. The model agrees reasonably with observed distributions of nutrients and with their biogeochemical fluxes. While theoretically superior, the diatoms are held in check by the availability of silicic acid, allowing the persistence and numerical dominance of the other algae. The concentrations of both nutrients are homeostatically controlled by the phytoplankton, and resist perturbations. Analysis finds that primary production in the model is ultimately controlled by phosphate, with silicic acid abundance controlling the fraction of the total produced by diatoms. Sensitivity analyses using more ecologically detailed variants of the model find that these results are generally robust. The model's treatment of the ``silica pump'' hypothesis [Dugdale and Wilkerson, 1998] is also examined.},

In the ABA-treated cells, the activities of two antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), were significantly higher than those in the untreated control.

  abstract = {The near-surface distribution and processes controlling the distribution of hydrogen peroxide were examined in the South and central Atlantic Ocean during a transect from Uruguay to Barbados in May and June 1996. Four kinds of field experiments were conducted during the cruise including diel observations, dark decay experiments, photochemical production experiments, and hydrogen peroxide-enrichment experiments. Significant diel variations ({$\sim$}25nM) of hydrogen peroxide were observed, with surface-water concentrations increasing during the day and decreasing at night. With a dark decay half-life of 5.5 days and a net rate of photochemical production of 8.3nM/h at local noon, it appears that both decay rate and photo-production rate of hydrogen peroxide are much smaller in oligotrophic seawater than in coastal seawater. The experimental results indicate that: (1) the decay reaction is a second-order reaction over all, first-order with both the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the concentration of colloidal material; (2) seawater in the study area could restore its ambient levels of hydrogen peroxide in about 4d after external perturbations. A total of 20 vertical profiles were obtained at 11 stations that can be classified as: surface maximum, surface mixed, and sub-surface maximum. Generally, the concentration of H2O2 decreased with depth to less than 5nM below 200m. Hydrogen peroxide also was determined in some water samples from below 200m, which revealed a slight increase of hydrogen peroxide with depth. In the surface waters of the open ocean, hydrogen peroxide increased with latitude from about 24nM in the south (33.8\textdegree S) to about 80nM in the north (8.9\textdegree N). This latitudinal variation of hydrogen peroxide correlated with model-calculated solar irradiance, satellite-measured wet deposition, depth of the mixed layer, and possibly total organic carbon. The water-column hydrogen peroxide inventory varied from 1.5 to 6.3\texttimes 10-3mol/m2. Although the greatest shallow water concentrations were observed at stations in the Amazon plume, these stations showed a dramatic decrease in hydrogen peroxide with depth and integrated-water-column hydrogen peroxide was not significantly higher than at open ocean stations.},

It is known that strong light stimulates the production of O2\textendash{} in Chattonella spp. but the mechanism of the light-induced production of O2\textendash{} remains to be clarified. In the present study, we examined the effects of light on extracellular levels of O2\textendash{} and photosynthesis in C. antiqua. Extracellular levels of O2\textendash{} rose during growth under high-intensity light, and the level of O2\textendash{} was correlated with the photosynthetic parameter qP, which reflects the rate of transport of electrons downstream of photosystem II. The production of O2\textendash{} was inhibited in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, an inhibitor of photosynthetic electron transport, suggesting that reducing power derived from electron transport might be required for the production of O2-. By contrast, the production of O2\textendash{} was enhanced in the presence of glycolaldehyde, an inhibitor of the Calvin-Benson cycle, suggesting that the accumulation of NADPH might stimulate the production of O2-. Thus, it is likely that the production of O2\textendash{} is regulated by photosynthesis in C. antiqua.},

We report another 18 diatom plastome sequences ranging in size from 119,120 to 201,816bp.

Multiple roles have been attributed to PTOX, such as involvement in carotene desaturation, a safety valve function, participation in the processes of chlororespiration and setting the redox poise for cyclic electron transport. We have investigated a homogenously pure MBP fusion of PTOX. The protein forms a homo-tetrameric complex containing 2 Fe per monomer and is very specific for the plastoquinone head-group. The reaction kinetics were investigated in a soluble monophasic system using chemically reduced decyl-plastoquinone (DPQ) as the model substrate and, in addition, in a biphasic (liposomal) system in which DPQ was reduced with DT-diaphorase. While PTOX did not detectably produce reactive oxygen species in the monophasic system, their formation was observed by room temperature EPR in the biphasic system in a [DPQH{$_2$}] and pH-dependent manner. This is probably the result of the higher concentration of DPQ achieved within the partial volume of the lipid bilayer and a higher Km observed with PTOX-membrane associates which is {$\approx$}47mM compared to the monophasic system where a Km of {$\approx$}74{$\mu$}M was determined. With liposomes and at the basic stromal pH of photosynthetically active chloroplasts, PTOX was antioxidant at low [DPQH{$_2$}] gaining prooxidant properties with increasing quinol concentrations. It is concluded that in vivo, PTOX can act as a safety valve when the steady state [PQH{$_2$}] is low while a certain amount of ROS is formed at high light intensities.},

  abstract = {The phagocyte NADPH oxidase flavocytochrome b558 is a membrane-bound heterodimer comprised of a glycosylated subunit, gp91phox, and a nonglycosylated subunit, p22phox. It contains two nonidentical heme groups that mediate the final steps of electron transfer to molecular oxygen (O2), resulting in the generation of superoxide ion (O2-). However, the location of the hemes within the flavocytochrome heterodimer remains controversial. In this study, we have used transgenic COS7 cell lines expressing gp91phox, p22phox, or both polypeptides to examine the relative role of each flavocytochrome b558 subunit in heme binding and O2- formation. A similar membrane localization was observed when gp91phox and p22phox were either expressed individually or coexpressed, as analyzed by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting of subcellular fractions. Spectral analysis of membranes prepared from COS7 cell lines expressing either gp91phox or both gp91phox and p22phox showed a b-type cytochrome with spectral characteristics identical to those of human neutrophil flavocytochrome b558. In contrast, no heme spectrum was detected in wild-type COS7 membranes or those containing only p22phox. Furthermore, redox titration studies suggested that two heme groups were contained in gp91phox expressed in COS7 membranes, with midpoint potentials of -264 and -233 mV that were very similar to those obtained for neutrophil flavocytochrome b558. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that gp91phox is the sole heme binding subunit of flavocytochrome b558. However, coexpression of gp91phox and p22phox in COS7 membranes was required to support O2- production in combination with neutrophil cytosol, indicating that the functional assembly of the active NADPH oxidase complex requires both subunits of flavocytochrome b558.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic microbes are of emerging interest as production organisms in biotechnology because they can grow autotrophically using sunlight, an abundant energy source, and CO2, a greenhouse gas. Important traits for such microbes are fast growth and amenability to genetic manipulation. Here we describe Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973, a unicellular cyanobacterium capable of rapid autotrophic growth, comparable to heterotrophic industrial hosts such as yeast. Synechococcus UTEX 2973 can be readily transformed for facile generation of desired knockout and knock-in mutations. Genome sequencing coupled with global proteomics studies revealed that Synechococcus UTEX 2973 is a close relative of the widely studied cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, an organism that grows more than two times slower. A small number of nucleotide changes are the only significant differences between the genomes of these two cyanobacterial strains. Thus, our study has unraveled genetic determinants necessary for rapid growth of cyanobacterial strains of significant industrial potential.},

We have determined the effective rate constants of the reactions of superoxide with Cu(I) and Cu(II) in seawater, using pulse radiolysis and kinetic spectrophotometry. Due to the effects of ionic strength and complexation, the observed rate constants, 1.98({$\pm$}0.05) \texttimes{} 109 M-1 s-1 and 0.663({$\pm$}0.071) \texttimes{} 109 M-1 s-1, for Cu(I) and Cu(lI), respectively, are 1 order of magnitude lower than those reported for Cu+ and Cu2+ in low ionic strength media. Measurements of the rate of O2- decay in the presence of catalytic concentrations of dissolved Cu agreed well with predictions based on the independently measured rate constants. Observed steady-state concentrations of Cu(I) in solutions exposed to a constant flux of O2- were also consistent with the measured rate constants. From these results and available data regarding Cu speciation in coastal and open oceans, we calculate that O2- reactions with Cu will be a more important sink of O2- than bimolecular dismutation, even if all organically complexed Cu species are unreactive.},

  abstract = {Sunlight photolyzes nitrite in seawater: NO2- + HOH + hv = NO + OH + OH-. We studied nitrite loss and nitric oxide production attributed to this reaction in surface waters of the equatorial Pacific near 170\textdegree W. Net photochemical loss rates of 2\textendash 15\% per day were derived from two different types of laboratory incubation experiments. The net nitrite loss rate in the surface water of this region is calculated to average 4 \texttimes{} 10-13 mol l-l s-l during the day, or {$\sim$}6 \texttimes{} 10-2 mol m-2 y-1. Nitric oxide was detected in situ with a floating gas-seawater equilibrator. NO was always detectable in nitrite-containing seawater during the day but was undetectable at night or in nitrite-free water. Near sunrises and sunsets the estimated NO vapor pressure, pNO(sea) covaried with the ambient UV insolation in air according to log pNO(sea) = a log UVair + b. Best-fit values to the in situ data indicate a {$\approx$} 1 with r2 {$\geq$} 0.9; simple kinetic models rationalize a values of O, {$\frac{1}{2}$}, or 1. During the day, pNO(sea) averaged {$\sim$}3.1 \texttimes{} 10-8 atm, corresponding to {$\sim$}4.6 \texttimes{} 10-11 M [NO]aq. The ambient atmospheric pNO was {$\sim$}104 -fold lower, implying a substantial seawater supersaturation and a sea \textrightarrow{} air flux. From the stagnant-boundary layer model and our measurements, we estimate {$\sim$}2 \texttimes{} 10-16 mol 1-1 s-1 ({$\sim$}1.3 \texttimes{} 108 molecule cm-2 s-1) of NO efflux in daylight, an insignificant NO loss from the sea. The photochemical NO source and the estimated dark reaction sink are, within the accuracy of the data, in balance. These results provide evidence for the presence of NO, a free radical, in surface seawater. They substantiate that photochemical reactions produce measurable concentrations of reactive intermediates in surface seawater and that these enter into rapid secondary reactions. These processes may reach sufficient intensity to provide significant effects, such as sea \textrightarrow{} air fluxes.},

In this work, we describe a protocol for removing associated bacteria from a monoclonal culture of Ulnaria danica isolated from Lake Baikal. The axenization strategy involves selecting the latent phase of diatom growth, multiple washes to remove extracellular polymeric substances and bacterial cells, filter deposition, and treatment with antibiotics that are not toxic for diatoms. The absence of bacteria during these stages was controlled by light microscopy with Alcian blue staining for mucus, epifluorescent microscopy with DAPI (4\&prime;,6-diamino-2-phenylindole) staining for bacterial DNA, and scanning electron microscopy of the diatom cell surface. High-throughput sequencing of a 16S rRNA fragment, amplified with universal bacterial primers, from total DNA of a final culture failed to detect any bacterial contamination, confirming successful axenization. A detailed comparative description of all stages of our protocol may prove useful in developing axenic cultures of other diatoms for various ecological and genetic studies.},

  abstract = {1-Methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium (MPDP+), a metabolic product of the nigrostriatal toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), has been shown to generate superoxide radicals during its autoxidation process. The generation of superoxide radicals was detected as a 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO).O2- spin adduct by spin trapping in combination with EPR techniques. The rate of formation of spin adduct was dependent not only on the concentrations of MPDP+ and oxygen but also on the pH of the system. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the spin adduct formation in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of DMPO to trap superoxide radicals, generated during the autoxidation of MPDP+, and of superoxide dismutase to effectively compete with this reaction for the available O2-, has been used as a convenient competition reaction to quantitatively determine various kinetic parameters. Thus, using this technique the rate constant for scavenging of superoxide radical by superoxide dismutase was found to be 7.56 x 10(9) M-1 s-1. The maximum rate of superoxide generation at a fixed spin trap concentration using different amounts of MPDP+ was found to be 4.48 x 10(-10) M s-1. The rate constant (K1) for MPDP+ making superoxide radical was found to be 3.97 x 10(-6) s-1. The secondary order rate constant (KDMPO) for DMPO-trapping superoxide radicals was found to be 10.2 M-1 s-1. The lifetime of superoxide radical at pH 10.0 was calculated to be 1.25 s. These values are in close agreement to the published values obtained using different experimental techniques. These results indicate that superoxide radicals are produced during spontaneous oxidation of MPDP+ and that EPR spin trapping can be used to determine the rate constants and lifetime of free radicals generated in aqueous solutions. It appears likely that the nigrostriatal toxicity of MPTP/MPDP+ leading to Parkinson's disease may largely be due to the reactivity of these radicals.}

  abstract = {Within natural waters, photodependent processes are generally considered the predominant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a suite of biogeochemically important molecules. However, recent discoveries of dark particle-associated ROS production in aquatic environments and extracellular ROS production by various microorganisms point to biological activity as a significant source of ROS in the absence of light. Thus, the objective of this study was to explore the occurrence of dark biological production of the ROS superoxide (O2\textendash ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in brackish and freshwater ponds. Here we show that the ROS superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were present in dark waters at comparable concentrations as in sunlit waters. This suggests that, at least for the short-lived superoxide species, light-independent processes were an important control on ROS levels in these natural waters. Indeed, we demonstrated that dark biological production of ROS extensively occurred in brackish and freshwater environments, with greater dark ROS production rates generally observed in the aphotic relative to the photic zone. Filtering and formaldehyde inhibition confirmed the biological nature of a majority of this dark ROS production, which likely involved phytoplankton, particle-associated heterotrophic bacteria, and NADH-oxidizing enzymes. We conclude that biological ROS production is widespread, including regions devoid of light, thereby expanding the relevance of these reactive molecules to all regions of our oxygenated global habit.}

The results indicated: cell death of T.~pseudonana happened under the stress of BDE-47, which was proved to be PCD based on the correlations with three biochemical markers (DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase activity) and three molecular markers [Metacaspase 2 gene (TpMC2), Death-associated protein gene (DAP3) and Death-specific protein 1 gene (TpDSP1)]; Furthermore, the changes of cellular ROS levels were correlated with the PCD markers and the dead cell rates, and the cell membrane and the chloroplast were identified as the major ROS production sites. Therefore, we concluded that PCD might be an important toxic mechanism of PBDEs on microalgal cells, and that chloroplast- and cell membrane-produced ROS was an important signaling molecule to mediate the PCD activation process. Our research firstly indicated microalgal PCD could be induced by PBDEs, and increased our knowledge of the toxic mechanisms by which POPs affect microalgal cells.},

  abstract = {The cosmopolitan algae Phaeocystis globosa forms harmful algal blooms frequently in a number of tropical and subtropical coastal regions in the past two decades. During the bloom, the giant colony, which is formed by P. globosa, is the dominant morphotype. However, the microenvironment and the microbial composition in the intracolonial fluid are poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to examine the bacterial composition and predicted functions in intracolonial fluid. Compared with the bacterial consortia in ambient seawater, intracolonial fluids possessed the lower levels of microbial richness and diversity, implying selectivity of bacteria by the unique intracolonial microenvironment enclosed within the P. globosa polysaccharide envelope. The bacterial consortia in intracolonial fluid were dominated by Balneola (48.6\% of total abundance) and Labrezia (28.5\%). The bacteria and microbial function enriched in intracolonial fluid were involved in aromatic benzenoid compounds degradation, DMSP and DMS production and consumption, and antibacterial compounds synthesis. We suggest that the P. globosa colonial envelope allows for the formation of a specific microenvironment; thus, the unique microbial consortia inhabiting intracolonial fluid has close interaction with P. globosa cells, which may benefit colony development.},

  abstract = {Oxygenic denitrification represents a new route in reductive nitrogen turnover which differs from canonical denitrification in how nitric oxide (NO) is transformed into dinitrogen gas. Instead of NO reduction via N2O to N2, NO is proposed to be directly disproportionated into N2 and O2 in oxygenic denitrification, catalyzed by the putative NO dismutase (Nod). Although a high diversity of nod genes has been recovered from various environments, still little is known about the niche partitioning and ecophysiology of oxygenic denitrifiers. One constraint is that nod as a functional marker for oxygenic denitrifiers is not well established. To address this issue, we compared the diversity and phylogeny of nod, 16S rRNA and pmoA gene sequences of four NC10 enrichments that are capable of methane-driven oxygenic denitrification and one environmental sample. The phylogenies of nod, 16S rRNA and pmoA genes of these cultures were generally congruent. And in each sample, the NC10 bacteria diversity inferred from different genes was also similar. A new set of NC10-specific nod primers was developed and used in qPCR. The abundance of NC10 bacteria inferred from nod genes was constantly lower than via 16S rRNA genes, but the difference was within one order of magnitude. These results suggest that nod is a suitable molecular marker for studying the diversity and phylogeny of methane-driven oxygenic denitrifiers, the further investigation of which may be of value to develop enhanced strategies for sustainable nitrogen or methane removal.},

  abstract = {The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4 has the smallest genome and cell size of all known photosynthetic organisms. Like all phototrophs at temperate latitudes, it experiences predictable daily variation in available light energy which leads to temporal regulation and partitioning of key cellular processes. To better understand the tempo and choreography of this minimal phototroph, we studied the entire transcriptome of the cell over a simulated daily light-dark cycle, and placed it in the context of diagnostic physiological and cell cycle parameters. All cells in the culture progressed through their cell cycles in synchrony, thus ensuring that our measurements reflected the behavior of individual cells. Ninety percent of the annotated genes were expressed, and 80\% had cyclic expression over the diel cycle. For most genes, expression peaked near sunrise or sunset, although more subtle phasing of gene expression was also evident. Periodicities of the transcripts of genes involved in physiological processes such as in cell cycle progression, photosynthesis, and phosphorus metabolism tracked the timing of these activities relative to the light-dark cycle. Furthermore, the transitions between photosynthesis during the day and catabolic consumption of energy reserves at night\textemdash{} metabolic processes that share some of the same enzymes \textemdash{} appear to be tightly choreographed at the level of RNA expression. In-depth investigation of these patterns identified potential regulatory proteins involved in balancing these opposing pathways. Finally, while this analysis has not helped resolve how a cell with so little regulatory capacity, and a `deficient' circadian mechanism, aligns its cell cycle and metabolism so tightly to a light-dark cycle, it does provide us with a valuable framework upon which to build when the Prochlorococcus proteome and metabolome become available.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) is a reactive oxygen species, derived from molecular oxygen, that is capable of damaging microbial cells. Surprisingly, the HOOH defence systems of some aerobes in the oxygenated marine environments are critically depleted, relative to model aerobes. For instance, the gene encoding catalase is absent in the numerically dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus. Accordingly, Prochlorococcus is highly susceptible to HOOH when exposed as pure cultures. Pure cultures do not exist in the marine environment, however. Catalase-positive community members can remove HOOH from the seawater medium, thus lowering the threat to Prochlorococcus and any other member that likewise lacks their own catalase. This cross-protection may constitute a loosely defined symbiosis, whereby the catalase-positive helper cells may benefit through the acquisition of nutrients released by the beneficiaries such as Prochlorococcus. Other members of the community that may be helped by the catalase-positive cells may include some lineages of Synechococcus \textendash{} the sister genus of Prochlorococcus \textendash{} as well as some lineages of SAR11 and ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria. The co-occurrence of catalase-positive and -negative members suggests that cross-protection from HOOH-mediated oxidative stress may play an important role in the construction of the marine microbial community.},

  abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of a variety of biological functions, and also has a role in the pathogenesis of cellular injury. It had been generally accepted that NO is solely generated in biological tissues by specific nitric oxide synthases (NOS) which metabolize arginine to citrulline with the formation of NO. However, NO can also be generated in tissues by either direct disproportionation or reduction of nitrite to NO under the acidic and highly reduced conditions which occur in disease states, such as ischemia. This NO formation is not blocked by NOS inhibitors and with long periods of ischemia progressing to necrosis, this mechanism of NO formation predominates. In postischemic tissues, NOS-independent NO generation has been observed to result in cellular injury with a loss of organ function. The kinetics and magnitude of nitrite disproportionation have been recently characterized and the corresponding rate law of NO formation derived. It was observed that the generation and accumulation of NO from typical nitrite concentrations found in biological tissues increases 100-fold when the pH falls from 7.4 to 5.5. It was also observed that ischemic cardiac tissue contains reducing equivalents which reduce nitrite to NO, further increasing the rate of NO formation more than 40-fold. Under these conditions, the magnitude of enzyme-independent NO generation exceeds that which can be generated by tissue concentrations of NOS. The existence of this enzyme-independent mechanism of NO formation has important implications in our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of tissue injury.},
